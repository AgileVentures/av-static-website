So after my rant about contracts and payments on Friday, I spent the weekend being unsure what I'd be working on Monday am.  Then Monday am came and I got to my computer at 9:30am and the money from a private client was in the bank indicating that the new project was go.  Now this gives me mixed feelings.  It means I might be able to take my kids to see their grandparents this summer, but it also means that I need to give 20 hours a week to a closed-source project for the next few weeks.  I spent a couple of hours installed the project on a new laptop to check for inconsistencies with the acceptance tests.  Did a write up of the install process, opened some tickets for the errors and got feedback from the client (who's another programmer) about the acceptance tests and how they had some more refactorings that would hopefully fix them.

I installed VSCode and reviewed some of the project code in that, marked off my time sheet for the new client and then had a full day of AV meetings from scrums, through mobs, to project meetings and community chats.  As part of this new flow I put off writing my blog until now at the very end of the day.  I think I was hoping that I might actually do review of some of the text in WebSiteOne and still be driving some ecosystem review with this blogging time, but I'm shattered at the end of the day, and it's the most I can do to cathartically spill out my thoughts on the day.  We had some new faces today and some returning old ones.  I feel like my Monday is too packed with meetings, I feel like I can't control myself at the end of the mobs to stop them on time and give myself space for a relaxing lunch break.  Maybe I need to start using a controlled timer that beeps at the end of the session ...?

I question the value of the betasaasers meeting - I enjoy catching up with the instructors, but I'm not sure how much revenue it helps me bring in.  Can I afford to carry on all the comfortable old stuff with these new contracts?  I had a feeling of energy in the morning as I tackled the new project and I enjoyed the elixir mob, but then I was tired after my hurried lunch, and while there were new people with new energy in the WebSiteOne meeting and the AV community chat I felt that I was lagging and tired and I have no idea if I was motivating or helping people.

At least one of these meetings needs to move to another day.  Maybe the AV Community meeting to Friday again?  We just moved the WSO meeting to Mondays to accomodate a load of people who don't show up any more ... the future seems so up in the air.  I think I've made a deal that means I can maybe do the autograders/betasaasers meeting every other week ... perhaps the WSO meeting should be on two week cycles itself?  Perhaps that would be a better way to go? Put everything on two week sprints and half the number of meetings?

I'm also really interested in the idea of doing full week sprints on particular projects to build up a head of steam.  I've been thinking about that for a while ... I feel like this constant switching between different projects keeps on making everything take longer.  If we could just focus and do a complete week of LocalSupport, a complete week of Paironauts, a complete week of WebSiteOne, a complete week of AsyncVoter, a complete week of Deep Learning I think we might break through and make more progress.  Of course I'll have to get these contracts out of the way first ... I wonder if the week sprint thing is something that anyone would pay for ...?
