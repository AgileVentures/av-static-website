So I'm on the train going into central London for a half day conference, and its standing room only during rush hour, so I'm writing this on my iPhone. I did start listening to a greater than code podcast, but unlike when I'm prepping Japanese tests for my kids I can't operate on two tasks in the same language in parallel.


This week I've been trying to make progress through sorting out the subscription histories for all the premium members. I haven't made as much progress as I would like due to a number of factors, but I have managed to touch base with at least one premium member in the process. That's partly what slows me down, i.e. reaching out in person to each Premium member as I review there subscription history.  Maybe it's just multitasking noise but I think I do need to load the individuals subscription history into my mind at the point that I contact them. Actually that'll happen as soon as I hear their name, but having their contact details at hand is a time saver. 


Part of me feels like I'm somehow being scheming and manipulative by keeping records on the Premium members, but with over fifty of them it starts to push my cognitive capacity.  Also I am genuinely trying to think about what's best for each of them. Of course I'm heavily biased in thinking that their are various ways in which AgileVentures can help, but I'm also genuinely interested in seeing how AgileVentures can adjust to meet their needs.


Each Premium member is an individual in their own right.  Most of them are working in full time or part time tech jobs whilst the remainder are in full time study or job hunts. I think all of them are interested in improving their tech skills, and giving back to the broader tech and nonprofit community.


Reaching out to each of them I have a mental model of their tech and nonprofit interests. I try to ask about how things are going with their work or their studies and see if they are interested in some of the latest developments and offerings at AgileVentures.


It's interesting to me how traditional education operates on a series of cycles, with groups of students coming together for certain periods and then moving on, sometimes never to see each other again.  I know I'm looking for something different - an ongoing lifelong learning community. It's not going to be for everybody, and already we've had community members come and go.


What I don't understand is what keeps some community members coming back and seeming to derive real long term value, versus others who don't seem to be that interested, or who engage for a while and then drop out never to return. Of course a big portion of the churn is a function of the rest of the world, with people moving countries, jobs, lifestyles and less to do with what AgileVentures is offering day to day and week to week.


It feels like we're seeing a very slow uptick, a slow accumulation of folks and input.  I can't tell if the trend will continue. It often feels that we're just putting together odds and ends of work. In the absence of full time staff it feels like we can't ever make significant progress on anything.


Which brings me to the idea of using Gitcoin ethereum bounties on some of our GitHub issues. Would that have an energising effect? Would it have a polluting effect on our community if learners? Probably worth an experiment ... makes me think of wanting to set different amounts for different timescales, e.g. 0.01ETH if you can get the task done in a month, but 0.1ETH if you can get the task done in a week.


We'll also need to be clear about getting approval to work on the task. What happens when more than one person submits work on the same paid task?
