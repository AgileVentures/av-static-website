So I got some great feedback from FutureLearn after I'd followed up to say how much I enjoyed their technical test and interview process (which included discussion and pair programming).  Here's what they said:

> Thanks again for coming in — I’m glad you enjoyed the process.  We really liked your technical skills, initiative and enthusiasm. You obviously have a lot of programming and agile experience, and have a lot to offer the team in terms of coaching, mentoring and supporting other developers. Ultimately we didn’t make you an offer because we had concerns about your communication skills. Your interviewers sometimes found it difficult to follow the conversation and get direct answers to the questions they asked; there was a general sense that your answers were sometimes circuitous or unclear, and that you didn’t express very much curiosity about what exactly the job would entail or what working at FutureLearn more generally would be like. In the end it was a very difficult decision given your high level of technical skill, but overall we felt it was unlikely to work out given the difficulties that your interviewers had in communicating comfortably with you

to which I responded:

> Thanks for coming back to me - that's wonderful feedback, and I really appreciate you sharing.

> It gives me great food for thought, and I think the concern about communication is a valid one.  It's something I definitely need to work on.   I tend to think out loud, and so going forward I'm going to try some experiments with different layers of filtering on how I respond to questions.

> As regards curiousity for what the job would entail and what working at FutureLearn would be like, I thought I was getting a really clear idea from the interview process itself.  Having taken courses on FutureLearn in the past, as well as having developed software and courses for edX as well as serving as a community manager for groups of edX instructors, everything I was hearing in the interview process gelled with how I imagined things would be, but it sounds like I could have worked harder to confirm my impressions.

> Either way I can certainly understand how a perceived lack of curiosity would impact your decision.  Thanks again for taking the time to interview me and sorry it didn't work out.

> Best of luck with everything at FutureLearn.

So I was disappointed not to have been made an offer, particularly since it would have helped address some of the financial concerns I have at the moment, and it would have been exciting to explore the codebase of the FutureLearn MOOC platform.  That said, I really am extraordinarily grateful for the extra feedback from FutureLearn.  In the absence of those specifics I might have imagined that the code that I wrote as part of the technical test, or something about my pair programming style might have been at fault.  However the concern about my communication skills fits in rather well with feedback and comments that I've got from other quarters.

The interesting question now is how to go about leveling up my communication skills. It sounds like it wouldn't hurt to try a period where I spent additional time constructing answers before starting to speak.  It's funny, there are so many online resources to help one learn to code, but level up your communication skills?  Well I googled for "improve your communication skills" and Google immediately highlighted:

###5 Ways to Improve Your Communication Skills

1) Never talk over people  
2) Don't finish other people's sentences  
3) Paraphrase  
4) Listen actively  
5) Maintain eye contact

Maybe not too hard then :-)  Stay tuned to this blog to hear about the results of my attempt to level up my communication skills ...
