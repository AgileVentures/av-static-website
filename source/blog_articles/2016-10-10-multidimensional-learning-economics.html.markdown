This weekend I ran my first Mentive class.  Mentive is an educational startup that provides tutoring for a number of different Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs), including our “Agile Development using Ruby on Rails”.  We’re currently running the part 2 or “advanced” course that corresponds to the second half of the UCBerkeley Software Engineering class.  It’s my first time trying out the Mentive system which uses GotoMeeting rather than Hangouts.  Myself and John Rofrano are running tutorial sessions through Mentive on this run.  We’ve both got a couple of students signed up.  I think the numbers might be down for a couple of reasons; one we removed all the deadlines on the “advanced” course as part of a move towards taking the classes completely self-paced next year.  That probably reduces the sense of urgency as regards sign up.  Also, I hear that Mentive increased their prices, and they may have tipped a limit that we’re also seeing with AgileVentures PremiumPlus.  I’ve had conversations with a few people that the £100 a month price tag on PremiumPlus is beyond their means.  Tweaking those prices and offerings are ultimately what makes all the difference perhaps.

So anyway, I usually have a rule of not doing any work on the weekends, but I had agreed to take a class on Saturday evenings, since weekday evenings are challenging for me due to early starts to support the daily school run.  Also I’m keen to support Mentive, understand their platform, and I furthermore I need to bring in some cash while AgileVentures works its way out of the red.  So I’m running my Mentive class at 8:30pm UTC on Saturday evenings, which makes in practical for anyone from UTC-7 to UTC+2 to attend, which encompasses most of the Americas, Europe and Africa.  I just had one student on this first instance, and so he got a focused one to one session.  We talked about how he had found the previous course, and what he was hoping to get out of this advanced course.  He shared that RSpec had been challenging and I reflected that he wasn’t alone.  The common refrain from the different instructors using the MOOC materials around the world was that people tended to get Cucumber, but struggled with Spec.  So in the session we worked through driving the creation of a small domain model of plain old Ruby objects via RSpec tests, and then did the same for a small Rails app that would use that domain model, driving the creation of an API with RspecRails tests.  My student seemed pretty pleased with that, and I’m looking forward to developing that further in future sessions.

Mentive classes are intended to support up to 20 students, and it would be interesting to see if the same guided app creation technique would work with a larger class, keep them engaged and so forth.  Doing it with a single student is not so far removed from what we do in PremiumPlus pairing sessions.  On Saturday my student was on a tablet, and so couldn’t easily type code, but I set up pairing intervention elements by stopping at points and asking my student what he thought I should do next, and that seemed to work well.  Obviously since it was only a single student I was able to tailor what we did and the pace directly to his preference.  Something that’s much more difficult to do with a larger group.
