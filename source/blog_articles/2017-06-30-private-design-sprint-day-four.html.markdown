I'm heading in to London on the train for day 5 following a frenetic day in London yesterday.  We got access to our space a little late, but proceeded to make good progress on the prototype with the designer cranking out a landscape, logo and background; and I got MarvelApp going through the gears to auto-play videos and provide the interactivity we needed.  The main snag was that the audio quality in the room we were in was not great and we needed to record of the order of ten short videos to make the prototype work.

Ultimately we had to give up and head off to a different part of London where we could film quietly.  I was working illustrator in the back of a cab at one point.  There was debate about a change of approach, but ultimately we got it all done.  The editor got all the videos sorted out, and I linked them all in to the prototype.  I was up late, but woke early.  I'd also phoned and confirmed all the testers for the Friday, and knowing that we had real people showing up to use the app kept me going despite exhaustion and the tail end of my cold.  Design sprint Thursdays do seem to be the most frenetic and least pleasant.  The one in which tempers fray.  I wonder if the prototyping would be better off starting on Wednesday.
