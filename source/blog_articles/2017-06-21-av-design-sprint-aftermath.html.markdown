I had been looking forward to a normal week following the AV design sprint, getting back to having standups and project meetings.  Frustratingly Monday was scattered with problems with hangouts that seemed to be specific to me.  The "Martin Fowler" scrum went okay, but I was unable to participate in the Monday marketing meeting due to my computer slowing to a crawl when I was running hangouts.  There was so much to discuss in the marketing meeting and I was effectively excluded on technology grounds.  Matt, Federico and Michael all tried to help me get to the bottom of it later in the day.  We thought we'd tracked it down to either the LAN cable or thunderbolt monitor as things seemed to improve when I switched to Wifi on my backup laptop.  However, broadband speed tests were showing the same results on both computers.  I managed normal participation in the AV community meeting using my backup laptop on the Wifi. 

I swapped out one LAN cable and it seemed like my main laptop improved in hangouts, but then they got worse and Wifi didn't seem to help.  The following day I phoned Apple and got advice to upgrade to OSX Sierra, which I reluctantly did.  I've been frustrated with Apple upgrades before, particularly since you can't back out of them.  I upgraded to Sierra over lunch yesterday and the computer seems to be working okay, although I haven't tried some of the trickier coding things that involve libraries installed via brew.   The "Kent Beck" scrum was just about manageable, but I was carefully monitoring my CPU's and noticing that things went a bit nuts occasionally with all eight cores maxing out.  I tried to switch to my backup computer with Wifi (that had worked for the AV community meeting) but the hangout wouldn't even finish loading.  I switched off my video on the main computer and watched the CPUs come back under control, and was able to complete the meeting.

It's super frustrating that when a hangout related CPU max out occurs that I can hardly do anything else.  I can't navigate in Slack, can't get other web pages to load.  My ability to function resolves around the ability to paste people links about things they are talking about in the hangout.  Following the scrum I ran a couple of NHS HLP hangouts.  Michael was in both.  We managed okay, but I definitely noticed illustrator being sluggish in the second one.  It really makes me thing we need an open source alternative to hangouts to be able to get to the bottom of these kinds of problems.  If I had the spare cash I'd love to just buy a new MacBookPro and exlude exotic hardware failures from the equation, but I don't really have that luxury at the moment.

I've been feeling my own mental CPUs thrashing trying to work out what to focus on each day.  My mood had been dipping but I found myself buoyed yesterday as we managed to identify the font that had been used in the AgileVentures logo, import that and create a "customized by AgileVentures" logo for the NHS HLP wiki site:

![customized by AgileVentures](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1kekg96rkndea64/customized-by-agileventures-176wide.png?dl=1)

I'd been putting off working on this, but as part of the design sprint we'd been using an [online font matching tool](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/matcherator) and we used the same technique to identify the AgileVentures logo font as ["Bree Serif Regular"](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bree-serif).  It's available for free, so I downloaded and installed on my newly upgrade OSX Sierra running mac, and the font became available in Illustrator.  A bit of playing around the gradients made it look similar enough to the existing "powered by MediaWiki" button to have it not look too out of place, and I found that adding these footer icons is a [trivial config operation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgFooterIcons#Site_customization) in MediaWiki.  Still frustraing that the hangout that allowed me to share and record all of this was slowing the process of experimenting with Illustrator.  I really prefer to just bang on things and look stuff up on Google rather than taking courses and reading documentation ... is that bad?

There's more I could keep tweaking, but diminishing returns?  At least with the gradients created for that "customized by agileventures" logo could be used to make the rounded rectangles in the Design Sprint's "Agile Journey" prototype more "clickable" looking.  That feels like nice cross-fertilization.  Moving forward I guess I just keep monitoring my CPU loads and see if we can't use things like [https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment) to create some transparent open source pairing/meeting solution where anyone who's interested can work on fixing issues with performance rather than closed source Google offerings.
