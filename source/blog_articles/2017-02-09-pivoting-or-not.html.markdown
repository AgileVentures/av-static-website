There was an interesting response to one of [recent blog posts](http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2017/01/23/passing_a_threshold/) from an AV community member.  They posted the following in our community #random channel (where I had shared my blog post):

> As an additional source of income for AV, why not offer pairing sessions for payment for those who may be reluctant to commit to a monthly fee? These sessions could be given to mentors who would be paid a proportion of the fee, thus perhaps incentivising more mentor-type people to join as well. A bit similar to what AirPair used to do although perhaps more from a learning point of view rather than a professional problem solving one as that was. So perhaps a student could pay for a session on a particularly difficult piece of homework, or a private project they are doing, or to better learn some concept or technique they are having problems with, or even just to practice coding and pair programming but without having to commit themselves to working on a project, which might be intimidating to some (and pairing not always available). These students might also in future be drawn into collaborating on actual AV projects. But in any case the pairing sessions themselves would bring in additional income.

And another community member responded, soon after, that they would pay for individual mentoring sessions, and we spent a little time discussing things in the "Martin Fowler" scrum.  I'm not sure what happened to AirPair.  According to their [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPair) they raised over $1M after a Y Combinator presentation, but the site currently has some authentication errors and I'm not seeing any activity there or on social media since mid-2016.  However, similar sites such as HackHands and CodeMentor seem to be ... oops, got distracted there.  I just went through the sign up processes for CodeMentor and HackHands.  Thought it would only take a couple of minutes, but CodeMentor included a timed assessment involving a pop quiz and a programming assignment.  Fortunately it was very similar to a kata I had completed not so long ago on Codewars, so I was able to polish it off pretty quickly.

Anyhow, talk about being easily distracted! :-) At least I've now got a good insight into the sign up experiences of those two companies.  So what our community member is suggesting is a lot like what I think CodeMentor and HackHands are offering.  What's not clear is how beneficial it would be for AgileVentures.  It feels like it will be difficult for us to compete with venture-backed companies in the same space, although as suggested, perhaps we focus more on the learning side?  I was originally tempted to respond in #random with my philosophy of openness in AgileVentures, but thought I'd save it for this blog.  One thing I've learned is that when people are giving you suggestions, they are generally not interested in hearing that you thought about them already, or why you haven't taken them up.  Far better to thank them for the great suggestions and ask simple follow up questions to find more about what they are thinking.

I'd love to bring in more money to AgileVentures, but I find helping individuals on their specific closed-source issues somewhat challenging.  Specifically because you often can't get the whole code system on your own machine quickly.  Perhaps I'm a deeply flawed and impatient person, but I find it difficult to cope with making suggestions verbally and then having someone stumble around in their own interface, mis-interpreting what I've said.  I guess that's what ScreenHero is for ... And maybe even uttering my honest thoughts here is self-destructive.  My hope with AgileVentures is to be doing the mentoring in the open, to enable more learners to learn from the contributions to open source projects.  Although I've come to see clearly that many learners crave privacy and are deeply embarrassed about asking questions in public, or in front of more than just a single mentor.  I assume this is all related to fear of failure, fear of being seen as less than competent etc.  I feel it too, but repeated practice has got me comfortable(-ish) with failing in public :-)

It's interesting that our community member mentions not having to commit to a project.  From my point of view if you just make one comment in one of our PRs, or just get the code set up and then never do anything, it's still a contribution.  It's what a lot of people seem to do; but perhaps many more are put off by the perception of needing to commit *to* a project.   I guess my big worry is that for all the time I spend helping other individuals on their private projects and homeworks, I'm not getting any multiplier for the community.  I can't share the code solution we discover, and I can't share the video of the techniques we used to discover the solution; but then again how many others actually benefit from all the AV videos we've shared?  How many others are really following the support given in psuedo-public in Slack?  Maybe the majority are all just hideously embarrassed by all this and that's why we keep struggling to achieve any sustained critical mass.

My mind does come round to feeling that the majority of people want polished content that they can consume in private.  There's so much less pressure, it's so much more convenient.  The cynic in me moans that so much of the polished content is not true to life, but then these days there are great screencasters out there (mainly outside of academia) showing folks how to actually do stuff, and maybe that's always going to be more successful than a system that attempts to get the majority to overcome their fear of learning, of failing, in front of others ...
