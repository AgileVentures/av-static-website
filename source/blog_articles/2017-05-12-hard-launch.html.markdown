So it's May 12th, the hard launch date for the wiki.  We talked about a soft launch on May 4th, and we had the basic system up for then.  The hard launch is now to have everything in place.  I've spent the week getting usability feedback from different stakeholders across London and now we've got to knuckle down and make sure everything is in place.  My personal action plan document has sprouted a whole section of stuff for the wiki:

* [ ] wiki launch 
  - [ ] adding t&c, privacy policy into the system 
  - [ ] moderation notification to more than one user
  - [ ] usability issues
    - [ ] default to visual editor on creating pages (or wikieditor?)
    - [x] save at bottom of page can be confusing in text editor -->  use wikieditor
    - [ ] help pages - upload all my training materials ...
    - [ ] moderation notice fails to load when using text editor?
    - [ ] can we make the search do an OR rather than an AND?
    - [ ] I'm worried the first page has far too much text ...
    - [ ] spaces on end of email address causing problems
    - [ ] creating an account does not log you in, or even guide you to log in or lead you towards what to do next
    - [ ] hide the bitnami management corner element
    - [ ] help pages
    
    
I've got open support tickets with various of these items.  I'd also like to be doing a full documentation of the entire wiki setup from scratch and practising recovery drills on another box, but it feels like I must focus the morning on triaging all the usability issues that came up this week and either fixing, working around or leaving as future work.  The danger is that any individual item could be dived in too deep, at the expense of getting a slew of other items sorted.  It's maybe time to break out a Pivotal Tracker, or perhaps a Trello instance to start tracking everything that's going on.  So I went ahead and did that.  Trello made more sense as I can't immediately see us voting on the complexity of the issues (although maybe we should), and Waffle doesn't make so much sense as we're not tightly integrated with GitHub for this project:

I made this Trello private to the team rather than public as this is a paid project, and we've got the double concern of our client sensitivity and also having some motivation for people to pay our Premium fees to get access to extra material.  I was also distracted from blogging, helping an HLP staff member sort out a table in one of the wiki pages.  Again the NHS firewall prevents us doing screenshare via Hangouts or Skype with anyone there, so a series of screenshots in Slack let me show the change manager what I had done, but I'm not confident that I've been able to transfer the skill of doing the task itself.

Anyhow, getting the Trello up has paid down my day's anxiety debt a little.  There's still lots to do, but at least I've got a better way of coordinating what we're doing.  The frustrating thing here is that the budget is on a scale that has prevented me from financially incentivizing more Premium members to get involved.  This project is actually a perfect microcosm of all the issues that Agile is supposed to handle.  It just doesn't have large tracts of programming activity.  Is that the fundamental mismatch here?  That I'm really interested in the problem solving and how the coding relates to project managment and delivering on client needs, when the majority of others are much more interested in just the code?
