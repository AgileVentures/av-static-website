So time to review the updates from the lead developer since last Tuesday. Not sure that I particularly follow the changes - I maybe need to set aside a full week to sprint through this up to a critical mass of progress.  Just loading the system it seems like the lead developer has sorted out the meta-data UI component and I see that loading one of my files we have the suggested translation of the entire sentence, or the saved partial translation that I created previously.  Hmm.  Closing that file (which I opened from the command line) and instead opening the project I get the same view. 

I hop over to Github where I can see the sets of tickets in the ASAP milestone.  It seems like the lead developer has taken care of the meta-data issues that my pair and I started on at the end of last week's session.  Does that now give us a clear run at the rest of the projects feature, or should we pick off bug fixes ...
