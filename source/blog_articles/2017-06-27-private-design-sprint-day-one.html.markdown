I'm in the Premier Inn restaurant again after day one of the sprint.  I've also come down with a cold which is not much fun.  Don't really have time to write a blog, as I'm supposed to be updating part 2 of the MOOC, but I thought I'd just take a few minutes to get down some reflections on yesterday's day one of the design sprint.  We had four of us in person in a lovely room with an ocean view, and we used a couple of flipboard markers and whiteboard rolls (that stick on windows and walls and allow you to draw on them).  It seemed to go pretty well.  This was probably the closest I've gotten so far to a day one of Design Sprint as intended, with the exception that we didn't have any expert interviews joining us, for one logistic reason and another.  We improvised there by taking turns to be experts and have each of us present the concepts to the rest of the group, and then all ask questions of the "expert".  I don't think we got the full benefit of outside input, but there was definitely some benefit derived from re-articulation of the idea from different perspectives.

The first map we made was maybe too detailed.  I was almost drawing interface elements, and one of the other team members did a revised simpler map.  The maps in the book are really simple, but they look simplified for the purpose of the book compared with the whiteboards I've glimpsed in the videos from Google. However Pat did seem to criticise our overly complex map from the AV design sprint; so perhaps this is a pattern of poor behaviour on my part.  Looking back I think it might have been more effective to avoid interface elements completely and focus on interactions; drawing person at computer, person talking to other person as the elements of the map.

I used the slide deck from the GV site to introduce the sprint in the morning and that seemed to work quite well.  Everyone seemed happy with me as the facilitator and the main client being the decider.  My handwriting for the sprint questions was not outstanding, and I'm not sure how powerful the questions were for the rest of the sprint.  I guess they were re-articulated by the presenters in the afternoon.  Interestingly people started writing "how we might fail" questions on post-it notes and there was a process of integration as I re-wrote them.  The others didn't join in the initial map drawing in the way that the AV folks did, collaborating in the drawing of the online map.  I did my best to map out what they were talking about, and it was great that they re-drew the map in simpler form.

It was interesting to see outbreaks of what might be called "argumentative" behaviour during the day.  Not in a negative sense, but more in a point and counterpoint, and point and counterpoint, that goes round and round.  I know I've been super guilty of this in the past, and it's interesting being a facilitator and working out how to move on from those areas.  From one perspective when both people have made their points, the key thing is to record the positions and allow the process to move on to generate more ideas.  That can be derailed when both parties feel the need to explain their position further, falling into a kind of "No, but ..." where effectively the same point (with minor nuances) gets repeated.  Is it partly about having the last word?  Why do I (and many others) want that last word so much?  I've often felt that if someone makes a statement that I feel is incorrect, that if I don't make the counterpoint then that's the statement that's being accepted by the room.  I guess I should trust people better that they won't think just because someone said something last that it's being accepted as truth.  Still it's a difficult character flaw to let go of.  If someone makes a point and you have no comeback then it can seem like you are conceding the point.

Fascinating to look at it from a third person point of view.  I can see how others can get frustrated with the debate where they feel they've heard both points of view in painful detail and just want to move on.   And it's clear how a debate can block the floor and prevent other issues being raised, other ideas being heard ...
