I'm in the Premier Inn restaurant again after day one of the sprint.  I've also come down with a cold which is not much fun.  Don't really have time to write a blog as I'm supposed to be updating part 2 of the MOOC, but I thought I'd just take a few minutes to get down some reflections on yesterday's day one of the design sprint.  We had four of us in person in a lovely room with an ocean view, and we used a couple of flipboard markers and whiteboard roles.  It seemed to go pretty well.  This was probably closest to Design Sprint as intended, with the exception that we didn't have any expert interviews joining us, for one logistic reason and another.  We improvised there by taking turns to be experts and have each of us present the concepts to the rest of the room, and then all asking questions of the "expert".  I don't think we got the full benefit of outside input, but there was definitely some benefit.

The first map we made was perhaps too detailed?  I was almost drawing interface elements, and one of the other team members did a revised simpler map.  The maps in the book are really simple, but they look simplified to me compared with the whiteboards I've glimpsed in the videos from Google, but Pat did seem to criticise our overly complex map from the AV design sprint, so perhaps this is a pattern of poor behaviour on my part ...
