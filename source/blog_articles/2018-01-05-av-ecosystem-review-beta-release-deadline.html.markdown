Okay, so I'm up against the deadline for the beta release of the APSoc membership database.  The timeline I gave them at the beginning of the project was:

* by Dec 8th - screenshots of membership database interface for you to approve
* by Dec 15th - alpha version of membership database for you to approve
* by Jan 5th - beta version of membership database adjusted as per feedback
* by Jan 31st - release version of membership database adjusted as per feedback, including full migration 

I managed to avoid losing any work yesterday, let's see if we can do the same today with appropriate dropbox backups.  What I need to do now is work through their list of fixes again, re-fixing the stuff I lost from Tuesday and Wednesday.
