What a week!  So many developments and me so internally conflicted.  Let me summarise some of the developments:

1. The UK Health Service (NHS) awards the AgileVentures charity a small grant to develop, host and moderate a "Social Prescribing" wiki
2. I land a medium sized private closed-source contract for an educational site through my company NeuroGrid
3. edX gives us the all clear to start another run of the MOOC in April
4. With some success I used my last two blogging sessions to grapple with some sticky issues on the LocalSupport codebase

So having the UK's NHS as a client of the AgileVentures charity could be a big step forward.  It's a small grant and I'm going into town today to get more details, but combine it with the small grant from WikiMedia EDU and we start to look like a respectable organisation that should be taken seriously :-)  I should be overjoyed, but I find myself conflicted because while it's great news, I need to take better paying gigs now to pay the bills.  To that end, landing this medium-sized closed source contract is another fantastic breakthrough.  It's a really interesting project, but the closed-source part of it makes me feel crestfallen.

I just love not having to be secretive about things.  I love the potential for everyone learning when we do all our coding out in the open.  Of course when people are putting money on the line for a business proposition they are not incentivized to share - they want to minimise the chance that others can capitalize on their breakthroughs.  And sometimes, at least superficially, closed-source is needed to close the deal, so to speak.  I feel crestfallen because I'd prefer to have 100% of my time spent on open-source code, open-access pairing with the AgileVentures community.  The new private project won't stop that completely, but it'll probably take up 50% of my time for a few months.  Of course that may be just what the community needs, me stepping back a bit in order to allow other community members to take the lead.  And based on my personality I know I'd carry on doing some things exactly the same way till I drove myself into the ground, so it's good to mix things up a bit.

In parallel I'm caught slightly off guard by the MOOC being able to go live.  The pressure is on me to come up with start dates and my quandry at the moment is working out if/how we run the TA training course in advance of it.  Running the MOOC takes me away from what I love the most, which is just coding and pairing, and we still don't have a great scalable framework for everyone doing that through the MOOC, or even via AgileVentures.  I managed to force myself to focus on unblocking some issues on the LocalSupport project this week by blogging about them, but I haven't really wrapped up other jobs that I'm only part way through on WebsiteOne, AsyncVoter and Redeemify.  Managing too many projects? Me? Argh, we need some mechanism to scaffold folks into project management roles or something ...

Could the combination of ongoing work by the marketing team and the start up of the MOOC take AgileVentures Premium subscriptions to the next level? At least I'm not going to be completely distracted by a new full time job.  I'm also doing remote pairing on toy-kata and other folks' personal projects just to mix things up, which is fun, but doesn't move forward the devops blocks on our Agile projects for non-profits.  I just wish we had a seemless framework in place to let folks pair online.  Google have split Hangouts into separate chat and meetup which seems insanity to me in terms of the gamified pairing experience I keep imagining.  Of course Google has their eye on other things.  Maybe once I've finished this private project we can do a design sprint on how to build (and fund) such a thing ...
