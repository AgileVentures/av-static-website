So the multiple repo functionality got deployed yesterday, which elicited a positive response from the user who'd reminded us about the need for this functionality:

but so back to the Premium Mob page grindstone, which I started yesterday ... and in fairly short order I've got that sorted on staging, cleaning up yesterday's text about the "why" questions:

and getting the faq into the dropdown bullet format:

I was all excited about adding images yesterday, but now I'm not so sure - at least large images in the dropdowns seem a little shocking - maybe smaller ones with text flowing around them ...?  Re-editing these pages is quite exhausting - all the copy and pasting of text into precise places of HTML.  Think I'll leave the Premium F2F page till tomorrow ...
