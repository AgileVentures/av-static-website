The new slack update message notifications for scrum hangouts and youtube links is out and working:

and at least two users are happy with the change.  So now I really must push on to the peformance issues.  I've merged the new feature flag that allows us to turn off the pre-loading of the next scrum, but I need that on staging to test it against production data ... I've got my load test of the homepage all ready to go on heroku via loader.io.

In the meantime I guess I should check that the new flag is working as expected on https://develop.agileventures.org/, but I go there and the next scrum is still on the home page:

Hmm, no notification of deployment to develop - I guess I'll force it:

```

```

And now the upcoming scrum is removed from the develop server.  I set the feature flag via the Heroku settings interface:

and the upcoming scrum is back with us.  Okay, feature flag is working as expected, but no sign of the build completing on staging.  I guess I will force it up so I can at least kick off the test before my next meeting, which I do ... and I get emailed the results - greater than 50% improvement:

Some decisions to be made here ...
