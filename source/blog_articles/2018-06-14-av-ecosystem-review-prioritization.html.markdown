Well it's coming up on a year of AV ecosystem review blogs and I sense that I've fallen into my older blogging habits.  At some level it's all about the AV ecosystem but not quite as focused on sorting out the website and the overall AV user experience.  My anxiety about all the things to do won't let me focus on that today.  Switching the project meetings to bi-weekly has created a bit more space, and I'm optimistic about ending this week a bit more on top of things; we'll see.  

Either way I find myself equivocating about what to work on first.  There's always several things that could be dived into.  Yesterday afternoon was focused on the NHS wiki project which provides a big portion of our budget and success is important, but what does success look like?  We've spent a fair amount of effort at trying to create a new mediawiki upgrade pathway over the last couple of months, and it still feels like we're only scratching the surface.

The merry-go-round in my head of things to sort include:

* [ ] invoicing
  - [x] new (recurring) invoices for UCBerkeley for supporting the autograder project
  - [ ] other small invoices for individuals (R., S., S.)
  
* [ ] AV AGM
  - [ ] writing my talks
  - [ ] checking everyone else is set correctly
  
* [ ] Sorting AV sponsorship policy

* [ ] Get data processing agreements in place

* [ ] Setting up new run of MOOC

So although I still have all sorts of quibbles and questions I went ahead and set up recurring invoices for UCBerkeley - something I should have done from the first invoice ... I need to also ensure that we get other months paid correctly - it doesn't seem possible to automatically specify the months in the recurring invoice.  We need to charge for two more quarters:

* Jan, Feb, Mar, 2018
* Apr, May, Jun, 2018

I guess I better reply to Armando, who is now in Europe, and we should be speaking soon.  I go on to respond to someone asking about setting up the LocalSupport software in Guatemala, but one of our trustees is suggesting I should be getting our official accounts sorted before the AGM ... I guess I at least start on that.  Looking through the documents I see that first up I need to get the trustees agreement to a letter of engagement of our independent financial examiner.  I think first up I need to speak to our treasurer in real-time.  I'm going to push up the latest LocalSupport changes in the meantime.

I get those up and get a call from our treasurer - all under control.  Right I think the way forward is clear ...
