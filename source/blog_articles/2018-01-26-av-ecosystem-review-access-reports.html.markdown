Maybe I should go back to blogging about stuff I've done rather than using the blogs to drive me through doing certain things in the morning.  I guess it's partly if these blogs really are just a log of what I'm doing, or are they somehow being fashioned to communicate something to someone ... it's frustrating that the attempt to keep myself focused on reviewing the AV ecosystem is now taken over by driving through an MSAccess application.  Delivering on this project is an important part of the AV Ecosystem yes, but this is not keeping me focused on the big picture.  Maybe I would have been better off taking several days or a week off from the usual AV activities to deliver on the project, and kept the blogs purely for core AV ecosystem thinking?  Maybe I should only be publishing one blog a week, or maybe I should be spending my morning writing time putting a book together ...?

Anyway, let's get these MS Access reports done ... took a little longer than expected, but I think I've got all the basics in there:

The key sticking point was getting one to appear per page, and needing to add a relationship between the tables in order to pull in the amount paid from a different table.  I did some address labels too:

Lots of clean up to make these look professional.  Maybe I should at least get the new client logo in before sending to the client ... okay, looks terrible in print preview, but this is a start:

I think I get this to the client (it's a beta) and get some feedback so I can plan the next round of work ...
