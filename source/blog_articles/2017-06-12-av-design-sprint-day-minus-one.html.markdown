I'm just back from a weekend wild camping in North Wales with by brother-in-law (who's training as a mountain leader) and my eldest son.  We had a great wet and windy time climbing mountains and camping in the wild by lakes.  It was great to get away and also to see my eldest son able to keep up with (and on occasion race ahead) of us.  He put up with some nasty weather, but was calm and made good decisions.  We got back late last night and I'm pretty shattered.  I'm going to need a couple of cups of coffee to wake myself up for the AgileVentures design sprint we are running this week.  We've got people from several time zones involved and we've set it to run from noon to 6pm to make it practical for myself in the UK and various east coast US folks to attend.  

This means I'm going to need to re-arrange various kid evening activities this week, but the US east coast folks will be getting up extra early, especially one who's on central (?) time.  We're all committing a big chunk of our week.  We've also got interns based in France and India joining in.  That it starts at noon for me means that I've got the morning to prepare and catch up with other things, although I'm not going to make much progress today until I've got some coffee in me.  We're departing in various ways from the classic Google Ventures design sprint.  We're trying to do it remotely (rather than co-located).  The GV sprint is supposed to be 10:30am to 5 or 6pm each day in a co-located venue, with a decent lunch break in between.  I'd been thinking that I'd have lunch early and push on through our 6 hour chunk, but now I'm not so sure.

I've bought TimeTimer software to display the countdown timers we should need for the sessions:

Which will float on my desktop, but I suspect we might suffer from other people not having multiple screens to display both timer (via hangout) and the google docs they'll need to be working in.  We'll see.  I need to get going and clear out the admin activities in the morning to get set up for this sprint, which is starting in just two hours.  Despite being away in dramatic scenery over the weekend, I still found myself repeatedley mulling over the sticky emotional interactions I had with some members of AgileVentures last week.  One of them is being particularly persistent in coming up over and over again.  Is that my ego being ridiculous, or is that my subconscious trying to tell me something?

There was also an odd synchronicity with a section in the book on "Parenting with Presence", by Susan Stiffleman that I'm reading, about apologizing, which was in a section on modelling behaviours to serve as an example for your children.  The four steps to deliver an apology are apparently:

1. "I'm sorry" spoken from the heart and without any explanations, which might be seen as an attempt to justify or defend what happened
2. "I imagine you felt _________," showing that you have stepped into the other person's shoes with empathy and concern.
3. "In the future ..."  Here is where you announce your intention to do better making it clear that the hurtful behaviour is not something you want to repeat.
4. "Is there anything you need from me?" You are inviting the other person to share whatever might be preventing him from forgiving you and moving on.

There's the suggestion also that trying to force children to say the words "I'm sorry" is not very meaningful and that apologies should be delivered with genuine remorse and involve the above four steps.  I am forever trying to stop my children from justifying and defending their actions, and get them instead to just apologise and focus on connecting with the other person.  I don't think I model the behaviour very well--pretty much always trying to explain and justify--and I'm starting to suspect that that gets me into a lot of trouble.

Of course work relationships are different from relationships with children.  I think the above pattern of four is for when you really feel you've done something wrong.  I'm also thinking about what Erin Flynn said in the Freelancers podcast about saying that you are sorry to hear that someone is upset, but making sure that you don't immediately apologise for having done something wrong yourse;f.  I think that makes sense too, because people are often upset about their perception of circumstances and you shouldn't just admit culpability because someone accuses you of something, but it certainy costs nothing to say that you feel sorry they feel that way.  I guess the trick is in the timing about when you can explore the issue without making the person even more upset.  There's an argument that in many situations you just can't get into the whys and wherefores without provoking further argument and upset and in those situations you just have to disengage.

My understanding of how to most effectively interact with people ... definitely a work in progress.  Just hearing what people say and offering no resistance or judgement whatsoever.  That's still a novel concept for me, and so different to my lifetime's habit of academic debate about what caused what.  Is the latter ever appropriate outside of academia?
