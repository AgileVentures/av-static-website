I'm finding my pace rather slow after the break.  At least I'm sleeping through my 6:30am alarms and not really rousing myself til 7:30am.  That's fine this week as my two youngest don't start school till next Monday so there's not a hard "we'll take you to court if you're kids are not in school on time" deadline that I'm breaking by catching some extra zzz's.  I assume my body just needs it after the rigors of last year and the holiday season.  I'm 45 this year, and I know that I've tended to work all my life (or at least since I was 23 or so) by pushing myself as hard as I can.  I think I've probably pushed too hard in the past to the detriment of personal relationships.  I might be in a different place if I'd been less aggressive in my relentless pursuit of a dozen "next things" in parallel.

For Xmas my wife bought me "Buddhism, Plain and Simple" by Steven Hagen.  It's similar in some ways to the "Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle, a book my mother bought me before she died.  I've read the "Power of Now" about five times, it's quite gripping.  I found the Buddhism book similar.  Both books talk about life at a level completely different from most works of fiction or pretty much any technical book I've read, asking you to think about how you interact with people, how you set your life goals etc.  The funny thing is that I feel I've had an intellectual insight into the whole thing that fits together elements from both books and various other experiences.  Ironically this has not allowed me to achieve Nirvana, Sartori, or become a Buddha :-)  It hasn't actually made much difference in my day to day, with the possible exception of not giving myself too much of a hard time about the extra hour of sleep this week - but then I was leaning in that direction anyway ...

The insight, if I can call it that, is that the Buddha-mind, or the "Power of Now", etc. the spiritual component that could be argued to underly many major religions, is about slowing your high level reasoning and processing, and just allowing yourself to float in the raw sensory data that you're experiencing.  The ever present, ongoing "now".  I suspect that this is the state that very small infants and children are in.  As we become adults, many of us become increasingly wrapped up in the conceptual world.  For example, on my morning walk I was listening to a software engineering podcast because I'm trying hard to keep up with all the latest trends so that I can do the best job I possibly can to support all the AgileVentures members, particularly the Premium ones, and turn AgileVentures into a sustainable charitable enterprise.  As I'm listening to the podcast I'm also slighly anxious about how to achieve that sustainability, how to ensure that we can afford our family trip to Japan this summer so that my children can spend time with their elderly Japanese grand-parents.

I think the "secret" of the Buddha or the "Power of Now" is being able to drop into that raw sensory experience at will.  It's not really a secret as all the books describe it in various ways and make the point about that you need to experience it yourself before it makes any sense.  The key is not that you stop planning or worrying about the practicalities of life, but that you are able to drop into a kind of no-worry, enjoyment of just "having senses experience", that helps you maintain a well-adjusted attitude to everything else.  When you're operating in the planning/conceptualizing level you are doing so in a more relaxed way because you see all the things as just concepts without concrete reality, and you can always drop back to the level of pure-sensory experience if it's getting too much.

Well, that's how I'm thinking about it at the moment, and surely my current "conceptualization" of this way of being is just that; only a partial representation of something; wrong in parts, maybe wrong entirely  It just all seems to fit together in my mind, connecting the "mysterious figure" in Steve Hagen's book, with the story of a Buddhist Master staring at a wall for seven years and 
Eckhart Tolle sitting on benches in parks for hours just reveling in the underlying beauty of reality.  If you're really connected to the pure sensory experience of the world, it's always enough by itself.  You could spend seven years staring at a wall appreciating the details of the experience you were going through and not be too affected by concepts like "you are wasting your time" or "what are you doing with your life".  

I spent several years researching NeuroScience as part of my PhD and this idea all fits in with how I see the brain as working; going from raw sensory data to concepts of increasing abstraction as we move further into the brain.  What's the upshot for me?  If AgileVentures doesn't achieve sustainability, and we end up not being able to afford the trip to Japan in the summer so my kids can spend time with their grandparents, it won't be the end of the world.  We've been the last five years in a row at considerable expense, but it will cause me grief at some level because by taking my kids to Japan to spend time with their grandparents I'm trying to make up for the early death of my parents.  My wife and I had our kids in Hawaii, many thousands of miles away from our extended family.  My parents both visited Hawaii and met my eldest son, but by the time he was two and a half they were both dead from cancer, and they never got to meet my youngest two boys.  I spent a year shuttling back from Hawaii to the UK trying to maximise the time I spent on developing my career in Hawaii and looking after my mother in the UK, and allowing her to spend time with her grandson.  We weren't sure when she was going to pass on, and she survived 18 months, but passed away just before we were returning to the UK for three months to be with her.  I couldn't get there to be with her when she died.

It's the biggest regret of my life.  Not so much that I couldn't be with her on that day, but more that we should just have quit our life in Hawaii while she was ill and stayed in the UK.  I was trying to carefully split the difference.  We weren't sure how long she had.  I made a gamble to hold on to career and life abroad, spending 1/4 time in the UK and 3/4 time in Hawaii.  I couldn't know at the time if it was the right gamble, but it wasn't until after I'd lost my mother that I realised how I'd calculated everything wrong.  Also my mother wanted me to follow my dreams and so although I think she wanted me to stay, she didn't ask me to.  Of course all of this is me conceptualizing about the past.  From one point of view, all these thoughts and ideas are just illusory with no concrete reality compared to the ever-present now.  I don't know, it all seems very real.  I cried when I wrote the end of the previous paragraph.  Something I rarely do.

Well, that all got rather intense.  I perhaps should have mentioned that my sister bought me a book called "The Orphaned Adult" by Alexander Levy for Xmas, and so I've been reading alot about parental bereavement recently.  I guess the point I was struggling towards was about unearthing the source of the anxiety I have about making AgileVentures succeed.  It's bound up with so much stuff.  I don't want to go back to a job in the city where everything is about making money for shareholders, and I don't get to spend so much time with my wife and kids.  I can't bear working in corporate secrecy.  I think information wants to be free; I don't want to have to spend every other moment thinking about whether I can reveal part of a code base or not, although I realise that with AgileVentures I still have a big obligation to privacy for our members, clients and sponsors regarding aspects of the data they share with us.

AgileVentures' mission of "in-context education" and working on projects to help the greater good is something I really believe in and something I feel I can dedicate myself to with an open heart.  But I shouldn't push myself too hard, and I shouldn't be too attached to some end goal of sustainability.  There's food on the table for the moment and lots of green shoots in our organisation.  I need to enjoy the process and occasionally take some breaks to revel in raw sensory data :-)

Slow, but steady.  That's what I meant to write about.  How I got a new filing cabinet for Xmas and how I'm steadily moving across chunks of things from the old broken down cabinet that came with us from Hawaii.  How every morning I'm trying to take at least one thing off my desk and file it.  How we're trying to chip away at all the little things in the AgileVentures technical and social eco-system.  It feels to me like there's so many little (and big) things to fix, and it's difficult to know which ones are highest priority.  Every little decision is a gamble.  There's no way to know which is the right way to go.  I've made some big gambles and I lived to regret them.  Enjoy the moment.
