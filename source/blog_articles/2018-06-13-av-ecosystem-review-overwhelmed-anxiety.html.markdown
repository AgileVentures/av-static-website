Am I overwhelmed by anxiety?  Recently I've been overwhelmed with remembering extra things that need to get done.  I'm slightly calmer this morning.  I went to bed earlier (without pushing out old blogs) and although I still woke up tired, I'm taking solace from not having any commitments before the Martin Fowler scrum this AM.  I've resolved to work through sorting out the AV sponsorships and completing the monthly report for the trustees.

One sponsor has four different customer accounts in Stripe.

1) Contains three Premium Mob sponsorships paid on the 2nd of every month
2) Is a cancelled subscription to Premium Mob, paying on 16th of every month and last paid in April
3) A Premium Mob upgrade which is paid on the 9th of every month
4) A Premium Mob upgrade which is paid on the 26th of every month

And I'm getting stuck here - I have a long slack message from the sponsor indicating that the subscription in customer account 2 above should be restarted.  There are also details about when sponsorships started, ghost days, unused Premium F2F sessions and I am having trouble working out what are the steps that make it all work out correctly.  The sponsor is making some alternative suggestions for how to resolve it all, but I find myself going round in circles in my head - like I don't have all the information to make the necessary decisions, or I need to split some of the components off before I can get clarity.

Maybe I have to work out exactly who is being sponsored for what at the moment ... I get that sorted in the report to the trustees and things feel a little bit clearer.  I'm starting to think that it's inappropriate for mentors or project managers to also be sponsors - seems like a conflict of interest to me.  Anyway, I think I've got to just send off my monthly report to the trustees.
