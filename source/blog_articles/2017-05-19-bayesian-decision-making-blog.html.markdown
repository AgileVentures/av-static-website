So my blog from yesterday isn't finished.  I got stuck halfway trying to document the mediawiki setup process, and then loads of other things fell on me.  I can feel my decision making process creaking.  I got caught for twenty minutes in Slack and email before starting this blog.  I'm reminded of the Bayesian approach to making decisions which seems eminently sensible and is all about working out prior probabilities.  It's been a while and I'm sure I'm mangling it, and anyway it's impossible to get accurate probabilities, but there's so many things I could work on, and it's so difficult to work out the actual rewards that come from each thing.  I've got to just start listing them out.

* Generate case studies of recent paid NHS and Wikimedia EDU projects (possibly even LocalSupport) 
  - time to complete; 2 hours?
  - potential benefit: could unlock funding from new Myanmar project
  
* Create bid for Capable Communities
  - time to complete; 1 hour?
  - potential benefit: could unlock funding
  
* Review new first MOOC assignment proposal
  - time to complete; 1 hour?
  - potential benefit: unclear, but MOOC does drive traffic to our site
  
* Respond to Code for Kindness
  - time to complete; 20 minutes
  - potential benefit: unclear, but could be good for collaboration
  
* Respond to Safecast
  - time to complete; 20 minutes
  - potential benefit: unclear, but could be good for collaboration
  
* Attending marketing meeting  
  - time to complete; ~1hour
  - potential benefit: unlocks other folks trying to collaborate on marketing strategy 
  
* Releasing latest WSO updates
  - time to complete; ~1hour
  - potential benefit: release change to flow that might have more people understanding benefits of Premium and then signing up
  
* Further investigating AsyncVoter routing issues
  - time to complete: unknown
  - potential benefit: clarity about Azure routing, unblocks developers to focus on code
  
* Sorting LocalSupport repo relations
  - time to complete: 15 mins
  - potential benefit: makes AgileVenture clear owner; and opens route to testing drie deploy
  
* Completing mediawiki install and config as clone of HLP wiki
  - time to complete: >2 hours?
  - potential benefit: gives us a much safer testing area for upgrades and changes
  
And there's a slew of other things.  I can't get everything done and each thing I have only rought ideas of the time it takes and what the potential benefits will be.  It wouldn't be such a big deal if I wasn't relying on opening the right doors to bring in enough money to feed my kids.  

I kicked off the WebSiteOne deployment in the background as that requires a few background steps for CI to run on each of the develop, staging and production instances.  The Bayesian approach calls for prior probabilities to be assessed.  The likelihood that each thing was successful in the past, to help weight which item to choose ... if I was calm I'd go and look up the formula, but I'm just too stressed at the moment.  I feel like the critical thing is to get the case-studies of our paid projects written up.  Even if they don't unlock fudning for this Myanmar project it's the kind of thing that's going to be useful to trot out when people ask, and the write up should contribute to one of my highest priority items, which is a plan for the AgileVentures charity to regularly pay for my family and I to eat.
