So I was all set for an early start at the blog face this morning, but just before I was about to have breakfast I got a call from Microsoft support wanting to talk about my support request for trying to get access to Office 365 as part of our non-profit status.  We need to use MSAccess as part of the Office 365 suite in order to check issues that the APSoc client is having on the membership database that we have created for them on MSAccess 2007.  I have to say that I was thoroughly confused by the sequence of MS login screens.  I seemed to have previously been able to download MS Access 2016 from the MS Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) on my Mac, but I couldn't seem to find the right kind of login steps to do the same on my PC.  At each step I seemed to be being asked to create a new account.

The MS support person got hooked into my computer so that they could see my desktop and it was clear that our Office 365 system was not connected up with any discounts or nonprofit licenses.  The MS Support person kindly went through the process of getting me logged into the VLSC, which involved dozens of password resests, email code activations, phone code activations and so forth.  It took us a good 45 minutes to get to the point that MS Access 2016 was downloading on my PC, but rather than install directly it was insisting to burn to a DVD, and I don't have a blank one in the house.  I put in an order from Amazon, and had to open a new ticket with the MS billing support team to see what we would need to do in order to get set up with nonprofit access to Office 365.  Apparently MSAccess 2016 and the MSAccess available through Office 365 may vary, so if we really want to track down APSoc bugs then we need that and not just MSAccess 2016.  

So all that took 45 minutes and then I'm late to the blog face.  One important block was removed, to reveal a sequence of other blocks.  One day at a time, one step at a time.  But so I don't think there's any point working on the APSoc membership database further today.  I'll likely be dragged into another phone call with MS later in the day, and I've got to make progress on our mynoteboat project estimate and proposal.  The client has sent me a new powerpoint with a mobile version of the app they want.

The client is telling me they have an android phone and that their sailor colleagues have a mix of iOS and android phones.  What I'm trying to do here is work out a project plan and estimate for mynoteboat.  I've got a framework that I use for private clients involving a design sprint, a bespoke build plan and a maintenance phase.  I think we need something similar for mynoteboat, but I sense that the full design sprint doesn't make sense.  They've pretty much provided a sketched out mobile prototype, although I can see it taking a day or so to turn it into an interactive prototype that they can play with on their phones. I guess I can still offer them pricing for the full design sprint.  Even if they think they're clear on what they want, there's value in the design sprint brainstorming and group working activities for getting everyone on the same page.  However they won't necessarily have the stomach for exploring the space of possible interface designs?

To give them a bigger quote on the entire piece of work I feel like we need to pull the set of things they want into a pivotal board or similar ... which I do:

and in collaboration with MikaÃ«l we get a proposal out to the client ...
