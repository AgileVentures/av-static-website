Gablurgh ... full day yesterday ... slow start today.  Let's put the reviewing older posts and changes to the side for the moment and put down some more changes to the "Getting Started" page that we can review again in a month to see the effect.  So right now we have the following steps in "Getting Started":

1. Find a project that interests you
2. Learn how we communicate and coordinate projects
3. Set up development environment
4. Have a closer look at chosen projects documentation
5. Join a standup
6. Start contributing
7. (Optional) Start your own project

So a low impact way for me to explore breaking these up is to create separate pages for each.  There's also considering the order that we have here, and whether we should add or remove things.  What could be cool is a clear call to action on each element.

The finding a project that interests you seems like a reasonable start assuming that folks have basically got the idea that AgileVentures is all about joining teams and participating in projects.  We've got a custom table here that highlights our top projects, and also shows the primary technologies, and lead contact name, which is something that is missing from our project page.

At the moment step two is a list of stuff with no clear action for the member reading the section.  It's potentially useful information about where things are found.  Is this the critical second step?  Do we derive any value from trying to get folks to read this here?  Or is it just a wall of text where we lose people?

Other things on my wishlist looking over this page:

a) contact name is a hyperlink to that person
b) technologies are dynamically pulled from GitHub
c) table of contents to let folks know what's coming
d) text under table of projects to include image, or animated gif, of saying hello in Slack
e) good tracking from step to step
f) clear calls to action ...

Still maybe the simplest thing is to create pages like

[https://www.agileventures.org/getting-started-1](https://www.agileventures.org/getting-started-1) could be an alternate mockup that I could share with key members for feedback ... okay all done.  I don't think I'll release this live yet - let's see what folks in #av_community_talk say first ...
