Day four was the usual frenetic prototype development day as in a traditional sprint, but we'd been at prototyping since the end of day two, so we had a bit of a head start.  Still we'd gone for prototyping in ReactNative and using expo to get the app on the client's mobile phone.  This was all working pretty well, and Nick had been working while I slept, with a series of pull requests to get each of the different ship maintenance screens set up with the different pop up text.

Throughout the day I worked on the main navigation screen and although not completely happy with the result I got SVG paths to show the kind of set up that the client wanted.  Couldn't get SVG images to appear on quite the right place though.  Later on we have the client coordinating with Federico and Nick to get all the text correct, and Federico had done all the checklists over night so we pulled those in too.  The app was starting to have the core maintainance and checklist features that the client had requested.

I was still very sick though and ideally I would have been sleeping all day, but there was no way I could put down a paid design sprint that I was the faciliator for, when the client was agreeing for full open source and open development and this could be a majoy contract for AgileVentures.  Federico might have been able to take the lead in my place, but he was sick too and I didn't think I could put that load on his volunteer shoulders.

It was then another challenging night of high fevers for me, but I got straight back on the computer pretty early in order to merge more overnight pulls from Nick and Federico.  Nick had got all the state persistence working on the maintenance screens and Federico had got placeholders in for the other static information parts of the system.  Even with lots of help from Nico we still hadn't worked out how to get SVG images appearing on the main screen in the way we wanted, or get the dynamic pie chart elements in the center of the navigation.  I seemed to have found a way to do the latter in SVG generally, but not in our react set up.  It was time for the first user study and the app had to be handed off.  How did the user studies go? Find out tomorrow :-)
