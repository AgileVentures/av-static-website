So I was going to off today to go out with my wife for her birthday, but one of my twin boys has the croup and a fever so we can't go. I'm going to do all the school run and teacher-parent meetings in the afternoon for her treat instead and we'll do the day out on another day, and so I'm at the computer.  I have managed to get on top of a few emails and meetings that were getting out of control, so that's good at least.  The advanced self-paced MOOC has gone live, and I've done a few startup admin tasks.  Not sure if I'll get to mailing announcements out, such a low level of motivation for doing that regularly at the moment.  Important though to keep the course seem like it's moving, but we've not managed to keep up much engagement from TAs ... guess I could kick those announcements out now, or I could push on to try and fix up a couple more premium subscription histories ...

Well I couldn't motivate myself to email the TA mailing list, but I could motivate myself to post an update about the free mob offering to the course, since conceivably that might lead to a few Premium Mob trials, and possibly even sign ups, although I guess it's the usual problem that we don't have enough mob slots in enough timezones, and people want more information up front, rather than just following us on social media, ... maybe ...
