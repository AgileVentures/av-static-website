Hmm, so the last two days I've adopted a new pattern of focusing first thing not on blogging, but on completing tasks from the previous night that I worry I'm not going to get done at all if I prioritize my repeating daily tasks.  It's also partly that my energy is at a massive low this week as I fight off the after-effects of the stomach bug from the weekend.  Adjusting the order of the morning has allowed me to reduce my stress level about repeated procrastination on certain items, and also get out a new google calendar appointment booking system to allow people to book pairing time with me:

I've successfully taken some bookings, but it's not as smooth as I would like.  It appears to require that people accept an email invitation after booking to confirm their slot, which seems rather error prone.  I've also started pulling in AV events to my Google nonprofit calendar associated with sam@agileventures.org.  I've been avoiding using Google calendar for a while as I don't like the way it restricts me, but the ad hoc scheduling I've been using is being overwhelmed by trying to manage all the different pairing bookings.  I'd love something integrated smoothly into the AV site, but am giving Google's appointment scheduler a go after seeing that youcanbook.me doesn't have a nonprofit discount and we don't have engineering capacity coming out of our ears at the moment.

I have to say I'm confused about what I'm in the middle of doing.  I've got two personal phone calls I'm making in parallel to blogging.  Trying to reduce our car insurance and sort out some personal tax issues.  Both things that involve being on hold for a good long time.  These interminal admin things need to get done, or hundreds of pounds just drifts away ... and I'm out of my comfort zone having to listen to tinny hold music instead of my spotify while I write my blog.  Okay, car insurance reduced, yay! No tax refund, boo!

I totally can't find my list of things that needed to get sorted, but in the WSO meeting I got some agreement that we could try out switching off the next event functionality as a way to check for performance improvements, which makes me think the focus for next week should be on our own jitsi meeting hosting, to see if we can get reliable performance from that and replace hangouts with something that will offer us an API for deeper integration with our site ...
