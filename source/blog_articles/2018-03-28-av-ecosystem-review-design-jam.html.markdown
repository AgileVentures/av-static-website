I'm back at my desk after yesterday's frenetic design jam day in Lambeth, just south of the river at the "Health Foundry", a digital health incubator.  The design jam was a full day doing the double diamond design process:

There were about 30 people there from a wide range of different groups.  Some clinicians, some patients, technologists, design folks and a mix of others.  I hope they'll send round a contact list after as I'd really like to keep in touch with lots of people.  I've just splurged five minutes with follow and counter follow on twitter for various people who were at the event.  I've got oodles of tabs of links from the event.  I want to share the agenda format.
