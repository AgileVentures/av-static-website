I'm back at my desk after yesterday's frenetic design jam day in Lambeth, just south of the river at the "Health Foundry", a digital health incubator.  The design jam was a full day doing the double diamond design process:

There were about 30 people there from a wide range of different groups.  Some clinicians, some patients, technologists, design folks and a mix of others.  I hope they'll send round a contact list after as I'd really like to keep in touch with lots of people.  I've just splurged five minutes with follow and counter follow on twitter for various people who were at the event.  I've got oodles of tabs of links from the event.  I want to share the agenda format.

The whole thing was like a full week design sprint in microcosm in a single day.   We all had name badges with coloured dots representing our different specialties as technologists, clinicians, patients, entrepeneurs and others.  We were encouraged to form teams with sets of overlapping skills.  After the initial presentations we were soon mixing and matching groups and I had a really enjoyable day hearing alot from teh Lambeth Patient Participation Group (PPG) who had there whole team scattered around the room.

By lunch we had settled on the follow mission statement:

> How can patients be aware of their PPG, its purpose & benefits and how to get involved and ultimately shape it?

This wasn't directly social prescribing, but I could tell that the PPG folks were really focused on how they could solve the immediate problems they were facing, and that they'd only just heard the term "Social Prescribing" for the first time today.  The Health Foundry wanted a brainstorming session on how we could more effectively implement Social Prescribing in Lambeth, but it seemed to me that empowering the PPG to get more members who could then effectively sign-post each other as to the most effective ways to manage their conditions would be Social Prescribing in everything other than name, and we'd have the benefit of trying to directly meet the needs of the stakeholders involved in our team.

Over lunch we talked about prototyping posters, emails and text messages.  I did the following sketch:

After lunch we worked through generating some personas:

As well as working out which stakeholders would be most effective at presenting what messages:

That led to poster sketches:

And then we generated three prototype posters:

which we evaluated by talking to a few folks on other teams and then presented to everyone else in our final pitch:

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/q1ztjv609oyfjma/sp_design_jam_pitch.jpg?dl=0)

where we presented the posters and the feedback we got from two clinicians and a patient

The Patient preferred the "Forum for your health concerns" poster.  They liked warm smile and specific message that help is available, along with specifics about where to get help.

The first clinician liked aspects of all three designs, in general preferring
 - less words
 - human faces
 - meeting time specifics in separate section

The second clinician
 - did not like "forum for your health concerns" as was focused on problems and concerns rather than assets and strengths of the individual
 - "join our patient network" felt vague - what is the patient network for?

It was a crazy intense day and a lot of fun.  I offered to the PPG that AgileVentures could design and host their website for free, and I made lots of other connections, so we'll see what it'll all lead to :-)  I was also impressed with the presentations from the other groups, and in particular the LoveLambeth group that was presenting a kind of SP mysocial for Lambeth as a way to allow everyone to publicly rate and comment on services available in the area:
