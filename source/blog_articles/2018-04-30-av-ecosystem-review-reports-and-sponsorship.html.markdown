So I've resolved to try and get permission to blog about the private coding project that I'm working on, if only to be able to talk about the software engineering architecture generalities.  I worked some on the project on Sunday with the intention of making some time available this morning to finish up the monthly report for the AgileVentures trustees.  I'm also resolving that I must try and sort out all the sponsorship connections and the new mentor incentivization package.  Part of the deal for the NeuroGrid support of AgileVentures is monthly reports and I have a feeling I am stuck in an over-reporting loop.  I think the trustees wanted the reports to be something that helps us manage the charity.  However I have this tendency to start generating reports that have too much data and then because each month I copy the format of the previous month I end up with the same "over-reporting" each month.  I did reduce the amount in the report based on feedback, but could it be reduced further?


At the moment the report consists of indicating when the project planning meetings are held and who attended.  This does give me a sense of who was there and who wasn't as the months change, but I'm not sure what we're getting from that information other than the re-assurance that I am running the meetings rather than just pretending to.  The report includes a table like this:

| Date | What             | Who                                          |
|------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 3/27 | Meeting held     | Ben, Mariam, Nico                            |
| 4/3  | Meeting not held |                                              |
| 4/10 | Meeting held     | Sam, Stella, Michael, Mariam                 |
| 4/17 | Meeting held     | Sam, Stella, Praveen, Mariam                 |
| 4/24 | Meeting held     | Sam, Nico, Ben, Mariam, Federico and Michael |

I also report the uptime for the main projects, e.g. for WebSiteOne that comes from NewRelic, which has been telling us 100% for many months. I also report the apdex score, which is a way of measuring how quickly our users get served pages.  We're holding steady at around 0.8, which is not super-wonderful, but not completely horrible, and the trend has been up as we've rolled out a few performance enhancing measures over the last few months.  I guess it's a good thing to check to ensure that the page delivery speed have not gone through the floor.

I also present some stats from Google Analytics.  Analytics gives lots of fancy graphs, but I boil down the overview to a couple of paragraphs like this: 

> This Month: From Mar 31 to Apr 29 we had 12,612 unique visitors to the site, of which 92.7% were new visitors.  The average session length was 49 seconds and the bounce rate was ~76%. Pages per session was 1.79.

> Last Month: From Mar 1 to Mar 30 we had 12,657 unique visitors to the site, of which 92.5% were new visitors.  The average session length was 57 seconds and the bounce rate was ~75%. Pages per session was 1.88.

The trends are all down here making it look like their are slighly fewer folks landing on our site, and they are not sticking around for long, although the absolute values are small, and likely in the noise range.   

I also add some stats from Google AdWords:

> We're not set up to see conversions from all sources on the main site, however we can see it for our Google AdWords campaigns which in the last month generated 323 conversions (new registered members) (vs 357 last month) from 13,339 click throughs.  We had no new Premium sign ups this month.

It feels like we could be doing a lot more with Google Adwords, but the control interface is a little opaque.  I think the key thing could be ramping up spending on the "Free Mob Programming" ads, and ensuring that we have tracking on conversions.  Anyway, so then it's on to report the same basic stats for the LocalSupport and AsyncVoter projects ...

That takes a chunk of time, and then I'm updating information on all the mob and f2f sessions that have been run, the changes in premium subscriptions.  There's lots of little reviews and checks and I get distracted by Slack as I check there for bits and pieces.  At the same time I guess I'm station keeping.  Would be great if the report was generated automatically and then I could just read it to get the value .... hmmm.

Anyway, managed to get the full report finished and sent out, although it took all the spare moments from the rest of the day.  I also separated out a section detailing who were the sponsored members, and who were the sponsors.  I also offered sponsorships to three new applicants based on the turn on the expiry of some existing three month sponsorship terms.  That's a chunk of stuff done - now on to the next battle :-)
