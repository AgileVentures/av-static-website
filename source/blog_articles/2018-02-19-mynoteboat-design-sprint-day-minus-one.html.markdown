So, another design sprint, and I'm not as early to my computer as I would like.  But I've got the time timer out, the sprint slides and the book on Kindle.  I've just about wrapped up the APSoc membership database (I hope) by working through my vacation last week, which was tanked anyway due to a cold and general collapse from exhaustion.  The challenge with this latest online sprint is that the client has got a pretty specific idea of the kind of mobile app that they want, so the open ended sprint format that leads to prototyping just anything doesn't quite make sense.  However I think parts from day one and day two where we try to drill down to work out exactly what problem is being solved here, make a stakeholder map and review other existing solutions is very relevant and so I'm planning to use those and co-opt some of the other parts of the sprint to be all about prototyping in HTML something that looks pretty much like what the client is envisioning.

Despite being "over" my cold and having a fair amount of sleep at the weekend, I'm still feeling exhausted.  Just getting changed from my work out clothes to my UK winter wear after breakfast feels like a struggle.  At least once I sit down at the computer with a pillow at my back I seem to be able to move forward.  There never seems to be enough time - onward ho!
