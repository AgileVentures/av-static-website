So Friday I had an intense day of meetings at NHS headquarters.  At the beginning of the week I had been suggesting to Brendan that Friday would be a day of prototype testing.  He'd arranged a series of meetings.  Three in person, two phone calls.  Skype wasn't working behind the NHS firewall, and due to the stop/start part-time nature of the whole thing it was clear that we were not going to have completed all the parts of the design sprint and got to testable prototypes for Friday.  The reality was that we were still doing expert interviews, and so I used the Friday to continue that process with five different stakeholders; specifically an NHS public champion, a CCG meta-commissioner, an HLP staff member, a service provider and an academic researcher.

I took notes on all and recorded the in person meetings, but there wasn't time to really digest in between the meetings, which had a max 30 minutes in between; during which time we were usually required to switch to a different room in the building due to the complicated NHS room booking system.  In small gaps in between the meetings I started to get Brendan set up with a Slack for Healthy London Partnership (HLP), added HLP to the Wikipedia page on London Health Care, discovered there is no wikipedia page on Social Prescribing, failed to follow up with the lawyers on ProBono legal advice, and discovered that HLP is not a registered charity.  We also got a sketch of the following week's plan in place, but the preponderance of phone offers made it look like if we were doing any usability studies it would be with HLP staff members rather than the other stakeholders.

I continued the process of showing the experts our A3 sheets with the long term goal, how we might fail and implementation maps.  The public champion added the phrase "Self Informing Community Commissioning" to our long term goal, and I took notes on a new A3 sheet of all the additional ways they suggested we might fail, e.g.

* All the different stakeholders operating in silos, and so we lose information that might help us achieve critical mass
* Small pilots with artificial communities difficult to get to work
* Commissioners scared of (funding?) groups without governance and insurance
* (NHS?) System not set up to commission self prescribing/social brokering
* Fear from existing workforce that their jobs will go
* Voluntary sector scared by austerity and so avoid collaboration
* That we don't learn from the social care (social brokering) experiment

It's difficult to get people to focus exclusively on how we might fail without them suggesting possible solutions, such as using wiki coordination to provide umbrellas for governance.  The public champion also pointed out that social prescription could be seen as just a re-branding of social brokering, something that had been promoted in the local authority context, but had been cut due to austerity measures over the last 10 years.  There's a narrative here that suggests cuts to what could be considered "preventative" services have lead to increasing demand on frontline health care services that the NHS supports.  I showed the champion our implementation maps, indicating some of the different funding frameworks, and they explained the different "funding trousers" of health care and social care, and then drew their own map with a different funding model:

Where "IAGs" are "Information, Advice and Guidance" services.  The public champion had built their own social brokering site using DotNetNuke called the ["London Brokerage Network"](http://www.londonbrokeragenetwork.com/).  The site is a paid members site which contains listings of different organisations providing advice and support services in London.


The SouthWest London CCG Support worker was saying that the SW London CCG's all had their own ad-hoc programs, and were interested to know what funding models were available to support SP.  The HLP staff member reacted viscerally to the different funding maps and proposed a new model with lots of new stakeholders (as well as telling me that he quite liked the http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Clash_of_Clans_Wiki wiki), while the service provider was less interested in the funding, but gave us great specifics about the program taking place in their area and how they brokered between individual patients and community resources.  Finally I heard from Brendan about the "social prescribing network" and we spoke to an academic researcher who had been involved in running the evaluation study for the Hackney Social Prescribing system.

Brendan said that he liked the BBC news web site.
