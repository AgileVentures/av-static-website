Squeezing in too much? Me? I'm just on the train coming back from a NorthWest London CCG meeting, where I had been invited to present the HLP Social Prescribing and Self Care wiki.  It was an all morning meeting and I couldn't stay for the second half as I had to get back to my home office for day three of the design sprint.  It might have been useful to stay for the second half of the meeting where they were going to be talking about a digital health app, and I would have hadthe chance to network with people after the meeting, but I'm committed to completing this design sprint.

In a face to face design sprint there'd be no time for me to squeeze in additional meetings (I've scheduled a Trustee meeting for Friday morning as well). However we are running the meetings noon-6pm so that the East coast participants can join, so in principle there istime.  Whether it's sensible or not is another question.

Looking back at day 2 there were a number of agenda items left from on Monday afternoon due to our plethora of expert interviews.  Nonetheless we polished them off fairly quickly; Tuesday starting off with further organising of our "how might we" notes and voting on them.  At the end of that process the board looked like this:

After a bit of negotiation we had four notes with at least 2 votes:

* ensure that developers understand how they will benefit from AgileVentures (before looking for projects)
* get sustaining revenue?
* better activate new signups into active community members?
* make it clearer what project opportunities exist in terms of languages/frameworks?

We added those to the appropriate places on our map, and as the decider I chose what the focus would be for the remainder of the sprint:

I chose "ensure that developers understand how they will benefit from AgileVentures (before looking for projects)" at least partly swayed by what Michael said that if you can't get people in the door then it's difficult to build anything further.  After a quick break we went into a series of lightning demos.  Here's what we each showed:

And we doodled design components while each other presented, which either went on paper or into our shared Google doc.  When we finished presenting to each other we spent some more time trying to write up the components. Here are some:

Then we moved on to the work-togther-alone group task on interface/storyboard sketching. Here we each worked on making notes, doodling more components, crazy 8 doodle variation generation with time constraints, and then finally a big chunk of time designing an interface/storyboard.  We were all in the hangout coming and going.  There was nothing much happening for the outside viewer as we were all trying to avoid showing what we were working on to each other.  Some of us were sketching on paper, and we had a debate about whether the final versions should all be in google doc format, or just scans from the paper, and ultimately I proposed that everyone should just use whatever medium allowed them to work most efficiently and we would worry later about anonymity of design.  At the end of the day we had four different storyboard prototypes that we put on the shelf to review on day three!
