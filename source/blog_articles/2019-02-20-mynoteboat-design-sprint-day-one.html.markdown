Exhausted again this morning, but the day one seemed to go pretty well.  I was quite nervous going into it, being unsure how many from the client's team and our team would be with us, and nervous about the sprint generally when the client already had such a specific prototype.  Nick and Nico joined us from our side and made great contributions.  Our client was there promptly and stayed with us all day.  Lara and Mikael joined us for expert interviews.  I was facilitator and the client was decider and it seemed to come together pretty well.  Here's the summary vison:

> MyNoteBoat the first ever app for navigators everywhere providing digital maintenance support.

> * Improving boat safety - ensuring boats maintained correctly
> * Increased enjoyment of boats of all kinds
> * Affordable
> * Supporting environmental concerns
> * Multilingual

> Users
> * 6 months → 200/300 users
> * 1 year → 1000 users
> * 5 years → >10,000 users

> A digital app to ensure safety and enjoyment for sailors and navigators everywhere

And some of the sprint questions:

> * How can we ensure the app does not rely on network connection? (need reminders)
> * How can we ensure users maintain access to their data?
> * How can we ensure the app can be affordably developed?
> * How can we ensure the user feedback makes the app better and improves usability?
> * How can we ensure the app is ready for the summer?
> * How can we make sure customers understand the value of the app?
> * How can we ensure the app is available on enough devices?
> * How can we ensure that data-entry is simple and easy? (dates, comments, emoticons)
> * How can we ensure that the app reminds people of safety issues with the correct urgency?
> * How can we ensure that the general data provided by the app is up to date?
> * How can we ensure that we build only what we need to make the app work?

At the end the decider was clear that the critical was to know the percentage of people who will pay for the app.  We're planning to look at other solutions this morning, and then I think we're going to get straight into prototyping so that we can have something for some real French sailors to try out on Friday.
