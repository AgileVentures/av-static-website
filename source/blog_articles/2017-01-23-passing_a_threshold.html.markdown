I collapsed with my cold after lunch on Friday and didn't wake up until after the "Kent Beck" scrum time.  I cancelled the remaining meetings for the day and took it easy; doing a little light devops work on WebsiteOne and LocalSupport later in the evening.  I continued chewing the ginger and got a good night's sleep.  Sensibly I would have done nothing all weekend, but that often doesn't feel like an option as a parent.  If I just stayed in my bed all weekend my kids would tear the house and each other up, and my wife would be driven to distraction.  I pulled myself out of bed to run my boys football (soccer) training session and then take my eldest to guitar and do the food shopping for the week.  I replaced the 2pm "Bob Martin" scrum with a text version and got another good night's sleep before driving my kids across town for their league match on Sunday and got a good Premium session in with Michael on Sunday afternoon.  Weekend accomplished!

The cold is still dragging on, and I'm working from bed today, and fingers crossed all the zinc from the ginger is shortening its duration.  Am I completely crazy?  Or just a workaholic father?  If I was salaried and could take a paid sick day I would, but I passed a threshold this weekend.  I went ahead and booked our summer trip to Japan, and came face to face with the depleted state of our finances.  I've been gradually working through our savings over the course of the last year, and although AgileVentures is bringing in around Â£1000 a month that's nowhere near enough to cover my time and money investment.  If we could double that I could just about cover our living expenses.  Realistically I need four times that to be fixing up the problems with our house and putting something by for retirement.  Not that AgileVentures is my sole source of income - even though I haven't actualy taken any income from AV yet - just putting everything in the charity bank account for the moment.  I get dribs and drabs from other bits of consulting work, but there's nothing regular at the moment.

It's been a great year.  We've got AgileVentures to a new level of activity.  We've got recognized as an official charity.  We've been on Ruby Rogues, and we've got a corporate sponsor, as well as a chunk of income from Premium memberships.  Still, something has to change now, at least as far as my personal finances are going.  We had only one additional Premium signup in January, and a couple of downgrades.  Most people are tightening their belts in January and February after festive binges, so it isn't too surprising if things will be slow till Spring hits us, but I'm going to have to start devoting increasing amounts of time to non-AgileVentures consulting work.  It's not the end of the road.  There are some important meetings today.  There's the possibility of some paid-work from our corporate sponsor, and a meeting with UCBerkeley/edX which will determine the flow of the MOOC this year, and there's potential profit share there.

In a traditional corporate job maybe I could just take a sick day today, but I've got online meetings with people in several different timezones, some of which have taken months to arrange.  I guess one choice would be to just pack it all in, say it was nice while it lasted, but from today I devote myself full time to getting some closed-source corporate job for whatever.  That's difficult to do when I love doing what I do for AgileVentures (blogging, coding, helping, reviewing, supporting folks).  Maybe that $10,000 a month AdWords grant from Google will make all the difference, but I've just had an email about technical issues with my account for the third time in a row!  So frustrating!  Here's the email:

I've had this email for my tansaku@gmail.com account, then again for a new marketing@agileventures.org account, and then now a second time for marketing@agileventures.org where I started completely from scratch, re-applying for Google non-profit status from the beginning with marketing@agileventures.org.  I've been on the phone with Google support twice.  I want to be spending time with marketing, and fixing up the site to help get more Premium users.  But first I guess I will have to do this dance with Google again.  How many more hours will it be navigating their system before it's not worth it?  Difficult to say.  $10,000 AdWords budget a month sounds great - the ad draft I put in predicted it would generate 100,000 or so impressions a month and 1000 click throughs.  That sounds good, but how many of those will we convert to Premium members or sponsors?  I'll keep bashing away and let you know ...
