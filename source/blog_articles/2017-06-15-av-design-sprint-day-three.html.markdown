It's Thursday and I'm looking back at day three of our design sprint that we did on Wednesday.  I think all of our energy was down after having done two full days in a single hangout.  I'd been out in the morning to attend an NHS meeting and I think that was pushing it.  Hopefully we'll all have got a good night's sleep last night and be somewhat refreshed for day four.  But so what did we actually do in day three?  We started by taking a look at the four different prototypes that we had designed independently on day two.  We did heat map stickers to highlight aspects of the designs we liked, and then Matt nominated me to talk through each in speed critique mode while he took notes on the standout ideas:  

## 1. Journey to Agile

Standout Ideas:
* Video Pitch (maybe put on top)

## 4. Guided Interactive Map

Standout Ideas:
* Diagram (clickable) perhaps cold lacking motivation, needs video(?)
* Description of value
* Time per week, updates map focus
* Popup of values
* Value proposition
* Multi-select of tech

It was relatively straightforward to allow us to put heat map stickers in the google doc once all the images had been added to drawings where we could overlay dots.   Here's the full sequence we were following:

1. Art museum. Tape the solution sketches to the wall in one long row.
2. Heat map. Have each person review the sketches silently and put one to three small dot stickers beside every part he or she likes. 
3. Speed critique. Three minutes per sketch. As a group, discuss the highlights of each solution. Capture standout ideas and important objections. At the end, ask the sketcher if the group missed anything. 
4. Straw poll. Each person silently chooses a favorite idea. All at once, each person places one large dot sticker to register his or her (nonbinding) vote.
5. Supervote. Give the Decider three large dot stickers and write her initials on the sticker. Explain that you’ll prototype and test the solutions the Decider chooses. 

In the above images you can also see some of the straw poll votes.  We were divided pretty evenly between the first and third. That's "Journey to Agile" and "Seeker on the Path".  So there was a decision to make, go with one or the other, or combine them in some fashion.  After some debate we narrowed it down to the following options:

1. Rumble (building two prototypes and two fake brand names)
2. Merge where click through on Agile Journey has pathways (multiple steps) (single prototype)
3. Merge where Seeker on the path has video or infographic of Agile Journey (single prototype)
4. Just do Agile Journey (single prototype) 
5. Just do Seeker on path (single protoype)

We took another poll on this, but as the decider the final decision was up to me.  We had votes for items 1 and 2, but I thought with a sprint team of four we didn't have the resources to make two prototypes, and I thought that we needed a single clear idea to make most effective use of the time and energy we were putting in.  In the background Federico was sorting out the advert for testers, the screening form, and getting the ads up onto craigslist around the world.  This was outstandingly helpful as I think our whole sprint team was exhausted and the logistics of managing the testers just seemed beyond us.

Federico joined the hangout on a couple of occasions to get input and decisions.  We decided to go for remote usability testing, and the full $100 Amazon gift card as compensation.  That's $500 which is a lot of money for our non-profit charity, but I thought we shouldn't skimp here and that we should be trying to get outside, unbiased input on the AgileVentures concept that we were trying to get across.  Our sprint focus was on:

> Ensure that developers understand how they will benefit from AgileVentures (before looking for projects)

Having made the decision, we moved on to making a storyboard to help structure the prototype we would build on Thursday.  I've noticed my computer getting slower and slower as these long hangouts run on with multiple large google doc windows open.  I've taken to quitting Slack and having that on another machine (if I need it) and even after a Chrome restart yesterday it was tough going trying to make the storyboard in a google doc.  We got as far as this:

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qoukd7h052vpko0/Screenshot%202017-06-15%2009.41.16.png?dl=1)

before I gave up, rebooted Chrome and started sketching on paper. My memory is that shared editing of the google drawing on day one had been a pretty efficient group operation.   I hadn't rebooted my computer since then and I think we were all mentally flagging.  As the computer starts to lag it becomes increasingly frustrating.  I thought that, based on the concept we were working on, the storyboard was pretty straightforward.  I uploaded what I had drawn:

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ay5i33jehioui5m/Screenshot%202017-06-15%2009.44.23.png?dl=1)

Either others were reasonably happy with it, or too tired to argue.  Matt said there weren't many "call to actions" and I pointed out the four "Learn More" and "Sign me up" buttons.  I started pushing to say that we should do a little work on what goes into the map, so we moved the diagram into a fresh location and I went round each person asking if there were items they wanted to add or remove:

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ukgpl9zhv6bewm6/Screenshot%202017-06-15%2009.45.34.png?dl=1)

and wrote up this list of tasks:

1. Finding Themed clipart
2. What goes in the map (ordering)
3. Making individual subtopic info sites
4. How does info popup (scroll, new page, popup)
5. Making map
6. Keynote vs Invision vs Middleman?

Matt was telling us he was getting to the point that he could only do simple tasks.  I thought I might be able to write up some subtopic text, at least if I did it locally in keynote.  We spent twenty minutes more with me going to each person and trying to ask what they would like to work on the list.  Maybe that was the wrong way to go.  It felt like we were moving in treacle.  Michael was talking through what each task involved.  I think there was confusion about whether we could work on things in parallel.  Ultimately Matt left, Lokesh started working on finding themed clipart, which Michael was doing in parallel.  I started on a keynote with subtopics, but got distracted searching for clipart.  The remaining time was spent looking at Shutterstock and other images like this:

I don't think any of us thought much of our artistic skills so the idea of having a pre-designed map showing a journey that we could put our own text into seemed pretty appealing.  The question was whether we had the software to edit the EPS files.  I played around with Sketch and Inkscape but ultimately made more progress downloading a free trial of illustrator.  We wrapped up and now it's Thursday and the Friday tests are looming.  Big day today to turn actually create our interactive infographic so that we can learn as much as possible on Friday.  Stay tuned to this blog to find out how it all goes!
