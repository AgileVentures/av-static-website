Okay, some coding needs to get done.  Right now there are several things that might bring in more critical revenue for AgileVentures:

* [PayPal integration](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1342)
* [Sponsor others functionality](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1344)
* [Mid range premium plans](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1343)

I have at least one potential sign up standing by on the first two, and after several rounds of feedback a general sense that releasing some mid ranger premium plans might have a significant impact.  Yesterday I burned a big chunk of time in a meeting with a potential sponsor, and if I can close that deal it's a big step forward, so I don't begrudge the time so much, but I didn't get much programming done.  Michael and I were mid-way through another feature to allow upgrade from premium to premium plus.  The [PR](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1323) is green after some solo work, but deploying it involves a data migration and there's a fair amount that could go wrong.

I'm also starting to ask myself if I could make faster progress on some of these things solo.  I've been very committed to pair programming for several years now and I really do believe in the value of pairing to distribute knowledge through the team, and to help everyone learn and improve.  However we don't have a big team to pair rotate through on WebSiteOne, and whilst we have onboarded or re-boarded a couple of junior/mid-level devs recently, the logistics of getting them together as they do job-hunts in parallel are making my head spin.  Back in the day I used to get up at 4am and do 3 hours coding before breakfast.  Maybe I need to do something like that again to push us forward, or maybe that would be grossly counter-productive.

Sensibly with all the features it's one thing at a time and don't stress too much about which to do first.  I think the existing feature needs to be pushed out.  In the long run it will make sense to support easy upgrade from one plan to the next.  Voting on the new features is sensible.  In the new AsyncVoter project we're making some good progress by having different people alternate taking the lead on the votes. I should push that in my other projects, although the nature of AsyncVoter is that everyone is keen to understand the "bot" role to help implement it.

I've got another long meeting today, which is an important chance to meet some different local charities but it will prevent me being at the "Martin Fowler" scrum, and I won't be able to help coordinate others pairing, or get much pairing done myself.  One of the big upsides of pairing is task focus.  Your pair helps you stay on task.  At the moment I'm heavily distracted by slack and email and a slew of different admin tasks.  One step at a time.  If I'm going to make my next meeting today's will have to be a short blog.  No bad thing perhaps as people keep telling me I go on to long.  More programming blogs soon I hope!
