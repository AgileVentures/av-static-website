So my taking one thing off my desk a day is at least keeping my desk in a steady state rather than becoming completely overwhelemed with pieces of paper.  I still haven't thrown out my old filing cabinet, and I got caught by Slack/Email before getting down to this blog ... urgh.  One day at a time on the ever present moment path to enlightement :-)  Anyhow, my generally despondent feelings about applying for grants were not buoyed by us failing to get the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital Website and Intranet project.  I think I spent about 4 or 5 hours on that last week.  A good learning experience for Pat, Lara and myself, and certainly worth going for, as landing it would have made a huge difference to the community.  Good preparation for subsequent bids, but a bit deflating coming hot on the heels of another bid failure from the previous Thursday.  I've now got a couple of other micro-bids on my plate, but I fear they might be distractions from the one larger project that by itself will probably sort my financial worries.

I need to have a proposal for that larger project done by this coming Monday.  No one's jumping out of Slack or Hangouts to make me work on it, so the danger is that I get distracted and fail to generate a good proposal.  I took some steps towards avoiding that last night by sorting a basic set of estimates, and also working with InVision.  I'm thinking about a [ThoughtBot style Design Sprint](https://thoughtbot.com/product-design-sprint/guide) for the client, and I notice that Thoughtbot is now recommending the [InVision system](https://www.invisionapp.com/) over paper prototyping for quickly preparing UI mockups to get quick feedback from stakeholders.  I spent a little time getting a version of the AV site up in InVision and got comfortable with the system.  The key thing is creating hot spots on images to allow users to click through from one screen mockup to another.  The experience can then be shared with a [link](https://invis.io/B7ARISKJV#/222386846_Home_Screen).

Not necessarily a quantum leap over doing the same sort of thing with PowerPoint or KeyNote, but the ability to drag and drop hotspots makes the InVision something that one can more quickly mock things up in.  Here you can see a few hotspots in green and the fixed nav bar that I made after just taking a few screenshots of the AV site:

Thoughtbot's [Proteus Middleman](https://github.com/thoughtbot/proteus-middleman) also looks like fun for things that need more complex interactions.  Having satisfied that I've got some good tools to work with for a Design Sprint, I think I pretty much have my proposal for next week.  Not sure if I need to write out a load more text - what I really want to do is pull a load more information out about the stakeholders and participants and so on.  What I will be needing to do is make a decision about CSS and JavaScript frameworks, and probably in the short term that will be Bootstrap and React, since those are the ones that I'm most comfortable with at the moment.

What I'm left with is the focus today, which I'd love to spend just kicking around more prototypes and exploring, or second best, just responding to the PRs and comments in my GitHub notifications, relating to the various AgileVentures projects.  However there's another small bid that I could be focused on.  Apparently today is the last day I can phone to ask questions about it, and it needs to be submitted for Friday.  It's small change, and feels a bit like a setup for more effort to be followed by a rejection, but even a single paid project now could serve as a great incentive to sign up more AgileVentures Premium members with the benefit of being eligible for such paid projects; which may be one of those things that can keep the community growing.  Okay, I've talked myself into it - I'll just make a coffee and get started.  Well after I've looked at one or two pull requests :-)
