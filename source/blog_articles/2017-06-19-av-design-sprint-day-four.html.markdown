So I was about to write up the events of our day four design sprint on Friday morning, when it was suddenly all hands on deck.  Actually I had been anticipating a busy morning.  As we finished the design sprint regular hours on Thursday we had a partially working prototype and I was the person with illustrator installed that could get the rest of the components working.  In the background Federico had put together an advert and screening questionnaire that he put out on Craigslist in a number of cities around the world in order recruit testers for Friday.  However, late Thursday it was looking like we didn't have anyone applying to be testers from our target demographic.  As I went to sleep on Thursday Federico and I were agreeing we might need to put the testing off to the following week. When I woke however we'd had another 150 applications from posting the ad on the Indeed network and had managed to get a handful of people in the target demographic.  Overnight Michael had made the decision to push ahead with testing to complete the design sprint within the week as intended.  It was a good call, but it was also relying on my completing the prototype in my Friday early hours.  I had said that I'd be able to do that, and I still was, but it meant blogging and other station keeping went out the window, particularly since I'd scheduled an important trustee meeting.  That meeting out of the way, I got down to finishing the prototype.

Given that we completed the full day of testing on Friday and I went away camping over the subsequent weekend I'm struggling to remember how we got to where we did at the end of Thursday.  Fortunately our Google doc for the day reminds me; we started off comparing prototyping tools, specifically:

* Invision
* SquareSpace
* Wix
* Keynote
* Middleman

As we discussed them, it became clear that Keynote wasn't going to work since we were testing remotely and we couldn't assume that we could get keynote running on the user's remote system in the fashion necessary.  Middleman was an option if we had form heavy interactions, but we didn't, and if possible we didn't want to burn time coding.  Matt and I had some experience with InVision, and I had installed Adobe Illustrator and checked that we could use it to take apart eps files that were available for sale on Shutterstock and others.  I'd tried Sketch and Inkscape and a few others and hadn't quite got the ability to take apart stock graphics in the way that we'd need.  Michael had some limited experience with SquareSpace and Lokesh even more limited with Wix.  I suggested that Michael and Lokesh should look at those two systems respectively, while Matt looked at InVision and I focused on Illustrator.  

Michael made some progress with SquareSpace, but it was unclear if we could easily get an image map set up.  Lokesh made good progress with Wix, but it seemed like he couldn't immediately lock click-through elements to part of a background image.  I'm sure we could have achieved some version of our imagined infographic with each system, but it was a question of how quickly we could get a relatively professional looking system into place.  We decided to go with Illustrator/Invision and Lokesh/Michael switched to image search.  Michael found another image on ShutterStock that he felt captured more of the ethos of his original design:

I'd managed to wrangle it into Illustrator, and get some alternate text in there that we could get to go operate like a popup in InVision using their hotspot tool.  We pretty much failed to follow the later script of the Thursday in that we didn't manage to do a trial run or work up an interview script.  As the day drew to a close Michael and Matt had found other "flat style" images to illustrate different parts of the journey, and I'd got the first one in a pop up that could be "clicked and closed" using screens in InVision:

We had a mechanism for constructing a professional looking interactive infographic, and it was now just a question of putting the rest together.  Michael and Matt had selected text and images for the other popups.  I called it a day and promised to complete the work with illustrator the following morning.  Lokesh also did some great follow up work in Wix, making it look like we could make a pretty professional looking website there quicky - good to know for a future design sprint.

As I mentioned at the start, later in the evening I was on Slack hearing about the trouble recruiting testers and I drifted off thinking I wouldn't have such a rushed day on Friday ... how wrong I was.  Stay tuned to this blog for more about how it all went down on Friday :-)
