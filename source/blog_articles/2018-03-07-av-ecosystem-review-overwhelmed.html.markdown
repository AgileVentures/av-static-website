So where to start this morning? I've tried to make my morning more efficient by putting off creating Japanese Kanji tests for my children later in the day.  Still not at the blogface as early as I would like and feeling overwhelmed in terms of what to focus on.  Things that could use working on include:

* sorting AV sponsor relations
* getting new websiteone README out
* getting back to review of flow through AV site
* new proposal for the NHS
* querying tender for Women and Girls network

Either which way it's already the 7th, so what I must do is update my own company's payroll information with the HMRC ... okay, one admin thing done and a reminder set for me to do the same next month.  And I followed through to pay the hanging PAYE charges.

Now, following on from my blog yesterday where I finally got in a pull request to update our websiteone README.  Since then Nico had adjusted the build buttons at the top.  He'd removed the longer set of info that included data about where the staging and develop servers are, the waffle board etc.  Maybe that's something we should move back in, but I'm keen to get this README out and iterate.  I'm nervous about how my potted "history" of the site might be received by some of the people involved in the project, but I can't always live life in fear.  I need to move this out, and then get on revising the project setup documentation and all the other bits and pieces that allow new folks to flow into the project.

Alright let's do it and make some time for a quick review of the sponsor relations ...
