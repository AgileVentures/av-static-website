When does an app become legacy?  I'd say pretty much as soon as you have anything deployed that anyone is using.  In my experience development on projects can stall and restart, but as long as people are deriving value from the application it needs to be maintained.  We hear things like 60% of the effort in a project is during the maintenance phase.  We have various projects in AgileVentures that could make the claim to be legacy codebases that need to be maintained.  Let me list them in the order of their creation:

* [AutoGraders}(https://github.com/saasbook/rag)
* LocalSupport
* WebSiteOne
* OSRA
* [MetPlus](https://github.com/AgileVentures/MetPlus_PETS)
* ProjectScope
* AsyncVoter
* SHF

Apologies for any I'm missing here.  There are other projects like VisitMeet and WikiEduDashboard which might also be put in the same set, but let's use the above set to think about the ongoing dance between development and maintanence.  The AutoGraders system was originally developed by Armando Fox and his students at UCBerkeley.  It continues to be used several years after its creation supporting the grading functionality in the "Agile Development using Ruby on Rails" MOOC.  Over the last five years there've been some periods of development work interspersed with longer periods of maintenance only:

In contrast development on (or at least commits to) LocalSupport has been steadier:

WebSiteOne on the other hand started with a very high number of commits and has gone through a couple of periods of development inactivity through its lifetime:

OSRA has seen a recent resurgence:

While MetPlus has seen some spikes, but has been pretty consistently active:

Not that the range of the above graphs is changing as we go through these projects, having started with the oldest.
