![marketing](/images/marketing.jpg)

Crazy day yesterday - felt pretty under attack on the AV front.  I'd love to lay it all in text, but I don't think I can indulge myself beyond what I typed up in private notes yesterday and I have a meeting with the NHS folks tomorrow, and I think highest priority is having at least part of a draft of a marketing report for them to look at.  I'm worried if I blog about anything else I'll just not get the report done, as I lost hours yesterday to reacting to what felt like emotionally charged posts on Slack.  So, what is the set of stuff that will go into the NHS Wiki marketing report?  Ironically I go to open Slack to find out, since I have recently posted bullet points for that into the #marketing channel ... here we go (and quickly turn Slack off before getting distracted):

Monthly moderation reports need to be submitted including the following:

* Number of rejected contributions with reasons
* Capacity required for moderation and time spent
* Any issues with the process and practice of moderation
* Other data as agreed to aid evaluation

The monthly reports must also include marketing data including the following:

* The number of user log-ins (unique and repeated)
* Number of users that logged in who commented or added to the wiki
* What sections of the resource receive the most activity from users
* Geographical location and role of user
* Information of promotion/marketing of the resource
* Other data as agreed to assist evaluation (i.e.uptime/downtime)

So let's work through each of these and pull up some numbers:

1. **Number of rejected contributions with reasons**

    71 rejected submissions of which 8 were tests by admin staff and 63 were "spam" (irrelevant) submissions 

2. **Capacity required for moderation and time spent**

    In this first month the 63 "spam" submissions were all very clearly irrelevant to the site, i.e. submissions on topics completely unrelated to healthcare.  The moderation was largely handled by the automated system.  Admins spent at most a couple of hours reviewing submissions, rejecting "spam" submissions and marking spammers as such.  Existing stakeholders were quickly marked as moderator approved (requiring no more than a couple of hours over the month), and as such there were no moderated submissions for that.

3. **Any issues with the process and practice of moderation**

    At the moment the ratio of spam to normal submissions is rather high and created the slight risk that a normal submission may be lost in the spam listings.  These automated spam submissions might be handled more effectively with MediaWiki policing like AbuseFilter, SpamBlacklist or ConfirmEdit, but these need testing to see the impact they might have on the submission process for regular users.

4. **Other data as agreed to aid evaluation**

    No other data yet requested

5. **The number of user log-ins (unique and repeated)**

    Logins are not required to view the site.   Site traffic from Google Analytics indicates that over the last month there were 293 visits to the site, corresponding to 134 different unique users.  The average session's duration was 5 minutes and 40 seconds, which involved visiting on average 4.6 pages. 

6. **Number of users that logged in who commented or added to the wiki**

    11 users were active in the last 30 days

9. **Information of promotion/marketing of the resource**

    AgileVentures has promoted the site through their monthly newsletter to their member base of over 4000 around the world, and linked the wiki into the Social Prescribing page on Wikipedia, as well as reaching out and inviting all the stakeholders involved in the design sprint to contribute.  We've also developed the following text for promoting the wiki on the HLP website:

    > Healthy London Partnerships (HLP) Proactive Care team presents a shared editable website (a "wiki") dedicated to Social Prescribing & Self Care. This wiki is available as an open resource for everyone who is interested in Social Prescribing & Self Care and related subject matters.  The wiki uses the same MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, and can be edited by any approved user. In the first instance the wiki is a repository for resources to support NHS commissioners and others to implement and develop social prescribing and self-care in their localities. Social prescribing, sometimes referred to as community referral, is a means of enabling GPs, nurses and other primary care professionals to refer people to a range of local, non-clinical services.  The wiki is hosted by the AgileVentures charity on behalf of the Healthy London Partnership.  AgileVentures ran a design sprint with the Proactive care team and stakeholders from all over London NHS and voluntary sector partners to identify the mediawiki solution as the one most likely to meet stakeholder needs.  Please check out the wiki at https://wiki.healthylondon.org and sign up for a free account in order to start contributing.

There we go, that's a way to stay focused - blog the report that needs to be written ... now to get this off to the NHS ...
