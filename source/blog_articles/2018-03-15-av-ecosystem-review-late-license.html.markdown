Another late session, another busy today.  Not quite as absolutely shattered as yesterday, but pretty far gone.  We had some packed meetings and scrums today, and I got a fair amount done.  I even got talking about a more coherent sprint structure for the LocalSupport project with a client meeting every two weeks and closing out tickets that get stale every two weeks.  So right I actually have some energy to look at some of the pages in AV.  What about creating some new text for [https://www.agileventures.org/learn](https://www.agileventures.org/learn).  Here's what we currently have:

Crowdsourced Learning
---------------------

> AgileVentures is a project incubator that stimulates and supports development of social innovations, open source and free software. But first and foremost, we are a place for learning and personal development with members from across the world with various levels of competence and experience in software development.

> In order to make learning across distances possible, we have adopted an organizational model that supports distributed software engineering as well as crowdsourced learning - an approach that aims to address the limitations of more traditional learning systems.

> Crowdsourced Learning is when two or more people attempt to learn something or gain a better understanding of a specific subject by solving a problem or set of problems together. Crowdsourced Learning is based on the idea that knowledge can be created within a group whose members actively interact by sharing experiences and take on asymmetric roles.

> In Crowdsourced Learning, the process is learner-centered rather than teacher-centered and knowledge is viewed as a social construct, facilitated by peer interaction, evaluation and cooperation. Unlike individual learning, members of groups engaged in crowdsourced learning capitalize on each others resources and skills (learners asking one another for information, evaluating one anotherâ€™s ideas, monitoring one another's work, etc.).

> Solely acting as a "manager" or "supervisor" is not enough if a group member wants to take an active role as a "driver" in a learning group. An individual that regularly takes on that role in group sessions, must concentrate less on creating a process of instruction or supervision, but more on the process of creating a learning environment. He or she must take on a role as a facilitator and mould, model, and encourage the desired behavior, with other group members being able and willing to adopt the core ideas of crowdsourced learning and participate in group activities regularly.

I think we're committing the sin of talking about what we are, not talking about what the people arriving at our site want.  We need to talk about learning from their perspective.  I think we need to trim the word count a little and add some pictures.

Learning how to Learn
=====================

What is Learning?
-----------------

We all know learning right? You sit in a class and someone tells you stuff.  You read a book.  Yes and no.  Learning is about getting answers to the questions you want answered.  Learning new skills.  You know learning, but do you know how to learn?

How to Learn?
-------------

You can learn from a class or a book, but you won't really start learning until you start doing.  But how do you know which the right thing to do?  You need a team, a group of fellow learners who are also doing, building, creating.  Then you'll really be learning.

How does Open Source and Open Development help?
-----------------------------------------------

Open source code means that there's an almost limitless amount of examples for you to learn from.  Open development means there are transparent team processes that you can take part in and learn from.

AgileVentures and TurboCharged Learning
----------------------------------------

Tired of toy projects and tutorials?  AgileVentures can find you a team of learners working on a worthwhile project in interesting and exciting new technology.  It's hard work, emotionally challenging even, but once you've got involved in an AgileVentures team you'll never look back.  Your learning will be turbocharged and you'll never be the same again.

Well that was short and sufficiently hyperbolus perhaps - now I just need to rustle up a few images ...
