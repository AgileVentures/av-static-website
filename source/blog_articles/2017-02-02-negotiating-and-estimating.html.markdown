Thomas asked a great question to DHH during our chat with him on Tuesday.  The question was:

> What are the biggest challenges of running a large scale open source project over time?

DHH answered in some detail, but the point that's stuck in my mind is that he said how difficult it was to be discussing absolutely everything in the full public spotlight on open mailing lists.  He said that over time they have evolved towards having private groups where discussion can move a bit faster.  I strongly believe in transparency as being a great enabler of trust and learning, but I would have to concur that doing absolutely everything in the open raises its own challenges.  For better or worse people will express different opinions in private and 121 discussions versus what they will say in public.

DHH also brought up the point that when the discussion is open to everyone, it creates the situation where anyone can bring their opinion, and that opinion might be well-informed and considered or it might be reactionary, or not so well-informed, or some combination.  I'm fascinated about the difference between people.  Some will be ultra-cautious about expressing an opinion, while others will have an opinion on everything and will express it regardless of the consequences.  Those are extremes and different people occupy different positions along the spectrum, varying over the course of their lives and sometimes even over the course of a day or a conversation.  I'm not casting judgement on others here.  I totally include my own behaviour in this reflection.

Anyhow, so the thing blotting out my sun at the moment is the process of negotiating and estimating for the drie dashboard project.  I'm really excited that drie have agreed to go with an open-source project as this massively increases the learning opportunities for our community, but since they are a for-profit company I have to think carefully about how we are structuring this.  I'm currently running this as a project for my own for-profit company, NeuroGrid, and will sub-contract out components of it to individuals wanting to work on it.  What I'd also like to do is have a public channel for the project on the AgileVentures Slack so that everyone in AgileVentures can learn from the process and the experience.

In the past when we've had paid projects from Non-Profit groups I was keen to share and make public the full estimating and negotiating process as a learning experience for all.  In this case I've demurred.  Perhaps I'm being too conservative, but I'm keeping the negotiating and estimating portion as a private conversation between NeuroGrid and drie.  While I'm sure there's lots that everyone could learn from making that process transparent, it's already a big leap for drie to agree to our open source, open development model, and I'd hate to jeopardize that by pushing for further transparency.  Hopefully once we've established the work model for all this we can go even further, but--bottom line--I've got to trust my intuition for what will work here.

What's really exciting is the opportunity to have AgileVentures members compensated for the skills they've been so dilligently developing on all the volunteer non-profit projects we've been working on over the last few years.  I ardently hope that an injection of income will invigorate rather than corrupt our community.  More news here as soon as we make it :-)
