Friday was full of meetings.  I started off heading down to the [Carramea Community Resource Center](https://www.harrowcn.org.uk/organisations/carramea-community-resource) (formerly the Consortium of Anti-Racist Refugee and Minority-Ethnic Associations). Carramea has been operating in South Harrow for over 12 years, and provides affordable office solutions for small charities and voluntary groups; as well as IT and Language classes.  I'd met the head honcho Tony O'Hara at local WoodCraft and other charity events, and that morning Rachel from Voluntary Action Harrow Cooperative was running a training session to show some of the staff how to work with Harrow Community Network (HCN), Do-It and SurveyMonkey.

I was there to observe and took notes as Rachel guided three staff through the mechanisms to update directory information in HCN, and to post volunteer opportunities.  Tony dropped in and out as he covered the reception desk while the training session was underway.  Rachel then went on to show how to post opportunities on Do-It and give pro-tips.  Carramea already had an opportunity up on Do-It (for volunteer receptionists) and it was already showing in our system, having been pulled in automatically from the Do-It database.

We may have been projecting, but it seemed clear that there was not much incentive for the Carramea staff to add volunteer opportunities directly through our interface unless it would also post them to Do-It.  And even then, it would probably take a superlative user experience, and posting to other sites such as TeamLondon and ReachSkills in order for it to be worth their while.  This sort of system does seem to be Rachel's vision for Harrow Community Network going forward.  No one wants to be entering the same information over and over, and if we can create a seamless experience that allows posting to multiple volunteer sites we really might start to see usage of the HCN site go up.

As Rachel went on to train the staff on SurveyMonkey one of the main things that seemed to be causing a drag was password management, and at the end when asked, I suggested that perhaps 1password or LastPass might be something that the Carramea might like to try internally.   It had been great to see a local charity being shown the HCN site.  As a training session we didn't get to see usability problems that might come up when the staff use it independently, but that pushes me to get better at monitoring and interpreting the site usage.

Then I dashed back to my home office to get the days blog up, try out a new process of editing blogs directly on GitHub and do pull requests from a branch to auto notify the #blog_drafts channel, then lunch and a Premium Plus pairing on P vs NP and classic problems like Travelling Salesman, Knapsack and 3-SAT.  I must dig out the paper I wrote on 3-Sat ...

There wasn't much chance to reflect though, I was immediately off to another local charity event.  Rachel had suggested I come along to the Youth First event, an initiative being funded by Harrow Council through the [Young Harrow Foundation](https://youngharrowfoundation.org), which seems to center around creating a platform for Youth services, resources and opportunities in Harrow.  In particular an app which young people could use on their phones to find out about activities and resources local to them in the hope that this would help those who might otherwise fall in with gangs or fall out of the system due to challenges such as mental health problems.  I got there early and did a quick on-location "Kent Beck Scrum".

At the event itself there were moving speeches by a former gang member, and another youth who'd faced mental health challenges, about the paths they'd ended up taking and how they'd turned things around.  There was enthusiastic applause for both, and I was particularly struck by the former gang member who'd turned to crime to get money to pay for things like going to football training.  I'm coach of an under eight soccer team, and it makes me think about ways in which we can make things more affordable for disadvantaged youths and their families.  I also met Lynne who works with former gang members and told me there are free football sessions being run in Harrow, so there's definitely room for connecting young people with the resources available to them.

There was concern voiced at the event about the longevity of the project.  Apparently a well-intentioned website had previously tried to do something similar in the past, but had fallen by the wayside.  We heard that the council had already selected an IT firm to deliver on the project for the next five years, but I worry that this will go the way of similar large projects where the feedback from the community and end-users do not reach the developers.  Or does not reach them quickly enough to have an impact.  Clearly disadvantaged youths are not going to always have cellphones, but care-worker and other support folks will, and in round table discussions we talked about how just having that information to hand could be very useful.  At the same time it's another dangerous "technology to the rescue" setup.  Another member of the round table pointed out that even with the information about what's available locally there's actually getting individuals to the take the step towards attending events, and reaching out for support.

Similarly it occurred to me on the way home that part of the challenge is the increasing population in Harrow, with many single family occupancy houses being turned into bedsits for 5 or 6, and the building of low-rise flats in almost every available free space.  Harrow might seem to be a privileged borough in North West London, but it's not without its problems.  The Youth Offer event was taking place the day after a [19 year old died](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/student-stabbed-outside-south-harrow-tube-station-loses-fight-for-life-a3403541.html) from an apparently unprovoked knife attack outside South Harrow tube station, just down the road from the Carremea offices.

It was a packed day, but great to see the connection between our work and members of the community.  The difficulty with being charity and non-profit focused is that money is scarce, and everything's being run on a shoestring.  And let's not fool ourselves that we'll have a positive impact by throwing technology at the problem; let's keep everything on the table and try to have an impact first and foremost and worry about which tools and technology we use second.  That said these are projects that you can really put your heart and soul into, because they are fighting to make a positive difference in people's lives, not just fighting to make a buck.  If you believe there's more to life than money then come join us and put your heart and soul into projects that can make a difference worth fighting for.
