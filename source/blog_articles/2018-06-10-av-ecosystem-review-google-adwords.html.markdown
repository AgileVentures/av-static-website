Blargh, working on a Sunday to catch up with the backlog.  Our Google Adwords account got suspended for some reason.  After a call with the AdWords support line we got an email with the following: 

> Thank you for contacting Google AdWord. As per the discussion, you need to make some more changes in the account i.e.

> * 5% monthly CTR
> * Relevant geo targeting
> * At least 2 ad groups and 2 site links per campaign,  2 active text ads per ad group
> * Need to respond to annual [Ad Grants survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczpnyIPjodpfXQFUzOr3djDeGcewLrtWG7Pn6ZO6O-PdNx-w/viewform)

Looking at our current Adgroups it seems like we have an average 6.50% CTR:

However all our campaigns had been global.  On the phone the Google person had explained that we needed to start with setting the geo-target to wherever it was that our charity was based, and then once we'd been re-activated we could add other territories, so I set the location for all three of our campaigns to United Kingdom only.

So let's look at the number of ad groups, site links and text ads per ad group for each campaign:

1. "Developers" --> 2 sitelink extensions

  Ad groups (2)
  
  * Developers, Coders, Programmers --> 4 ads
  * Agile Terms --> 3 ads
  
  
2. "Charity Org" --> 3 sitelink extensions (look identical to "Developers" ones above)

  Ad groups (1)
  
  * Charities looking for app solutions --> 1 ad
  
3. "Free Mob Programming" --> No sitelink extensions

  Ad groups (1)
  
  * Free Mobbing Session --> 2 ads
  
So it looks like at least two of our campaigns need updating.  I had thinking to add the free pair programming to the free mob programming campaign, so that seems like a good thing to add there:

and I'll need at least two ads for it.  Here's one:

And here's another:

and I rename the "Free Mob Programming" campaign to "F2F/Mob Offers".  Now I need sitelink extensions on this - I create some new ones:

And I re-use the membership plans sitelink from other campaigns, although I guess I should be linking to the Premium Mob page as well ... I throw that in, and this campaign should now meet Google's requirements.  However we need another ad group for the charities campaign, and at least two ads in that ad group:

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/0zssew82iw9dvc2/Screenshot%202018-06-10%2017.00.24.png?dl=0)

and at least two sitelink extensions for that ad campaign:

So I think that's done it.  Now to take their survey ... five pages of stuff about how we use AdGrants, our organisation etc.  Filled that in and what the customer support person said online was that completing the survey would automatically trigger another review of our account and potentially un-suspend it.  However that hasn't happened automatically - I guess I will have to check that again tomorrow ...
