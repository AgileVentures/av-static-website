So I've told the APSoc that I'd send them mockups of the interfaces today.  I'm getting used to LibreOffice, e.g. leave the control panel open to more easily edit labels etc. It's still painfully slow, and I've now realised that to speed up I need to keep the control panel closed when I want to move things around.  The copy and paste seems to work only intermittently, but I'm getting there ...
