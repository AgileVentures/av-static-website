If I learned one thing from the NHS design sprint it's get the sprint day blog numbering sorted! :-) I think I'm on top of it this time.  I started yesterday with a minus-one blog and so today's day one blog looks back at day one that we had yesterday as we get set for day two coming up later today.  We did an intense six hours yesterday, all online, with Matt, Michael and myself in the same hangout for the whole time.  We did start off with Lokesh, but he suffered a power cut and had to drop out which was a shame.  A couple of others who might have been going to join us couldn't make it, so we were down to a pretty bare sprint team of three, but that was more than we had for the NHS design sprint, so my personal design sprint trend is up.   We also had five experts give their input and opinions.

We operated out of this [Day 1 document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-58E54GHIg8OrZdsPe55O9-mEVcNmGFa7roe9ya-mzw/edit#), getting the schedule in there and recording the long term goal and listing up a set of sprint questions:

> Significant number of people having authentic learning experiences on real projects helping good causes around the world.
 
> The real projects should be receiving real support that leads to satisfied clients.
 
> The whole process should be sustainable, by which we mean can we generate enough income to pay for services necessary to run the organisation (e.g. server costs, software costs, staff costs, contractor costs).

* Will clients ever be satisfied with work from group of volunteers?
* Will large numbers of developers ever get over the idea of “paying” for volunteering?
* Will we be able to present projects in such a way so that developers can find ones they will be a good fit for?
* Will we be able to present meeting time schedules so developers and clients can be available at the right time to coordinate?
* Will we be able to provide good online communication (chat, real-time) mechanisms that enough people will find easy to use?
* Will we be able to communicate the benefits of additional (premium?) support so that we can increase the numbers willing to pay for it?
* Will we be able to provide the right level of structure so that developers and clients feel supported, but are also free to make the decisions that are part of learning?
* Will we have enough income so that we can compensate those who want to put in additional time, or more generally pay for the services needed to sustain the overall operation?
* Will we work out how to allocate funds effectively?
* Will some customers be willing to pay for support and development?
* Will learners be enticed to pay for our services?
* Will Sam be overwhelmed and without significant assistance or automation?
* Will learners have a clear path to progress?
* How will we allocate funds to maintain AV as a venture?
* Will turnover of volunteers make projects suffer?
* Will customers, especially paying ones, trust a group of volunteers with their project?
* Will learners really pay to learn if there isn’t a “real” credential?
* Will staff time be taken up with increasing amounts of administrivia?
* Will existing key technological infrastructure fall into disrepair?
* Will there be enough people in the world who really want to learn through authentic volunteer experiences to make this all worthwhile?
* Will we attract a critical mass of volunteers so people can find each other when they want and have time to volunteer?

and generated the following map of the interaction between different stakeholders moving towards our goal state:

I'd say that the Google docs were pretty efficient for doing all this online.  Being able to put questions and thoughts about long term goals directly into the same document that we could all see seemed to allow us to move pretty fast.  Similarly for the generation of the interaction map, although I did notice my computer lagging as we went on, perhaps from having the hangout running for so long.  Still, for what we lost in time in generating the diagram is sort of made up for in the greater legibility of the result and the fact that we can move boxes around (refactoring) and the arrows all stay connected.  I think one of the key benefits is from making this map together so that we're all undestanding it from the inside out.  I'm not sure how useful it is for conveying our ideas to others, but anyhow ...

In the sprint Matt took the lead as facilitator and I was the decider, which seemed to work pretty well for day one.  The main difficulty we had was that the availability of our experts were spread out over a larger time frame than we would have liked, so that rather than talking to all our experts we had a couple of interviews followed by a 30 minute break, then one more, then another break etc.  There wasn't much we could do about that, so we put together a "how might we" notes in another google doc in the breaks, and made reasonable progress.  We started organising them into categories:

![HMW notes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m9huy92cclkz2n2/Screenshot%202017-06-13%2009.23.16.png?dl=1)

I had to finish promptly to go for family supper while Matt and Michael finished up the last interview.  I noticed that those experts who'd been following our video feed or looking at our documents in advance were able to hit the ground running and give us more detailed feedback, as we each took turns talking the experts through the goal, questions and interaction map.  What we didn't do was the final component where we vote on the HMW notes and then attach them to the interaction map and make a decision on which part of the process to focus on for the rest of the sprint.  We weighed the pros and cons of cancelling the last couple of interviews versus sacrificing some of the competitor product review the following day and went with completing interviews with all the experts we had scheduled.

Even though we were bending the sprint rules, I felt that we did better at sticking to the overall sprint philosophy than we did with the NHS sprint.  That's understandable given the wider sets of constraints for the NHS wiki project, and either way I'm very much looking forward to the rest of the week.  One of things it makes me think is that going forward I would really like to be doing focused sprints on just one project or another, e.g. spend a week (two weeks?) purely focused on the AsyncVoter project, or the LocalSupport project, or what have you.  I wonder if there could even be a different kind of AgileVentures Premium product.  For those people less interested in a monthly subscription, perhaps they'd be more interested in an intense week or two working on a project?  People could take time off work for it - get accelerated to the next level.  The trick is in the communication, I think.  It's about getting across the value proposition.  Independently of any particular product, I'd love to generate that intense focus on particular projects.  I sense the constant changing from different project, day to day, is meaning it takes longer to break through certain tricky issues, get coherent shared understanding.

Anyway, design sprint onward ho!
