I took a week off over Easter.  I definitely needed it.  Particularly after the time change and the intensity of the NHS project I had to step away.  I seem to remember working through Easter and school half terms in the past, but it seems counter-productive now.  Quite an effort to get back into the swing of things.  We had a public holiday yesterday (Monday) and I ended up doing a half day on this and that, mainly writing up my phone meeting with a G.P. (UK doctor), planning, putting in a couple of funding requests and writing a draft business plan for the charity.

My knee has been approved for jogging again, so I'm getting back into my morning run, and have switched round with my wife so she's taking the twins to school in the morning.  If we're going to deliver effectively on the NHS project and ensure we put in enough other funding requests for the long term then I need more work time.  Ironically it didn't generate any more work time this morning as I fell asleep again after the alarm and I'm still sitting down to blog at the usual time.  Hopefully my body clock will be back to normal soon and I can squeeze out a few more work hours.

I really did appreciate having a Monday without any meetings - it gave me time to sort out some goals for the week:

* [ ] apply for other funding ...
  * [x] City Bridge Trust - follow up would be electronic
  * [x] Diana and Allan Morgenthau Charitable Trust - follow up would be by surface email
  * [ ] apply for others in list

* [ ] generate next kind of solution for NHS
  - [ ] get as much of their drupal site as we can --> Kim (phone? brendan?)
  - [ ] we need to move towards a new round of testing
  - [ ] finish writing up/distributing notes
  - [ ] legal support --> business plan?

* [ ] follow up with Simon (after another review of the design sprint book)

* [ ] release next week of AV102 (fixes needed?)

* [ ] some framework for premiums and mentors in AV 
  - [x] ask each mentor individually ...
  - [ ] ask each mentor individually about getting more involved following up with individual mentees ...

* [ ] sort timings of scrums and weekly meetings ...

With Slack and email there are always a 1001 little admin things to do and questions to be answered.  My suspicion is that if I want AgileVentures to be something I can keep putting the majority of my time into, I have to prioritise doing those things that only I am in a position to do, e.g. taking the initiative putting in funding applications.  Our marketing intern Marufa took the initiaive to find a site called [Funding Central](http://www.fundingcentral.org.uk/) that lists potential funding opportunities for charities.  Beore my break I did their guided search and came up with a handfull of options.  On the last Friday of work I'd put together another funding proposal for an EU fund, but stupidly missed the deadline due to miscalculating the time difference with Europe.  They wouldn't accept it after the deadline.  Here's the proposal:

#### 1. Project title (10 words max).

> Sponsored IT & Software Development Mentorship for the Underprivileged

#### 2. One-line introduction to your idea (140 characters max).

> Donors provide sponsorship funds to support the mentorship of underprivileged individuals to improve their IT & software development skills.

#### 3. Provide a summary of your idea highlighting how it relates to the theme ‘Equality Rebooted’, how it aims to make technological change/digital transformation more inclusive (100 words max).

> Technological change and digital transformation relies on individuals from all walks of life having access to training and professional development in the skills of the new digital economy. Not everyone can afford professional mentorship, however a coordinated donor/sponsorship program can bring these benefits to anyone with an internet connection.

#### 4. Explain why your idea is innovative in the country or context where it will be implemented. If your idea is based on an existing concept, explain what is different about it (250 words max).

> Our idea is innovative in as much as we are relying on the bare minimum of resources from the under-privileged individuals we are trying to support; simply time and and internet connection. Mentorship and professional development are existing approaches used in industry, but are often unavailable to those with limited resources. Our idea works with funds from those more privileged individuals who want to give back to the community to help others get a leg up, and uses those funds to provide mentorship and professional development support to the under-privileged who are trying to make their way in the new digital economy.

#### 5. Describe clearly what impact you expect your idea to have and how you will achieve this (250 words max).

> The impact of our idea is a larger number of under-privileged individuals from a wider variety of backgrounds taking their place in the digital economy. Our approach will redress some of the inequalities currently seen in the digital workforce and will do so my pairing experienced mentors and professionals with under-privileged individuals to provide them with support and guidance on making use of the latest digital tools, and honing their skills according to a coherent professional development plan.

#### 6. Indicate at what scale your idea will operate initially and how it could be transferred to another area in Europe or scaled up at a national and/or European level in the future (200 words max).

> We are currently working with U.S. based funders to provide mentorship and professional development support from U.K. based mentors to under-privileged individuals in Kenya and India. We also currently have volunteer U.S. and U.K. based mentors working with individuals in Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, Tunisia and various other countries. We would very much like funds to reach out to more potential sponsors and donors to put more of our volunteer efforts on a more sustainable footing. So far we have a 3000 member organisation being supported by a dozen professional mentors. In principle there is no limit to the scale at which we can operate.

#### 7. Outline how your idea could become financially sustainable over the next three years (200 words max).

> Our operation relies on input from donors, corporate sponsorship, premium membership and contracts with non-profits, charities, government and businesses with a commitment to social responsibility. We are currently covering costs, but relying heavily on volunteer input. We currently have three donors, three corporate sponsors and fifty premium members, which is covering all our IT hosting and support costs, but not any staff costs. Our plan is to double the current income through these various methods in the next 6 months in order to start to employ staff to ensure there is consistent and reliable support for all our mentors and mentees. Funding from equality rebooted would very much increase the chances of us succeeding in our sustainability goals.

I knocked out the above on the train into London for a day of wiki usability testing at NHS headquarters.  I'm not saying it's of any serious quality, but I can generate text like that to order.  All the plans and ideas for AgileVentures bublle in my mind.  It was disappointing to miss the deadline by 30 minutes, but that energized me to take some of the above prose and use that to make a couple of email submissions to funding bodies I had found in the [Funding Central](http://www.fundingcentral.org.uk/) site.  Doing that allowed me to tick off a couple of items on the weekly todo list, and I pushed forward to create a [draft business plan](https://www.agileventures.org/business-plan) that might help us unlock pro-bono legal support, and maybe serve as a banner to rally the team around.  I also started reaching out to our mentors to see if they were interested in AV sponsoring their training for Agile/Scrum certificates; although the Premium subscriptions seem to have plateaued, they may start to rise again with the new MOOC and change in season, and there's already some upgrades going on, so I suspect that I need to engage the other mentors more directly with the larger body of Premium members, and then focus my resources on supporting the mentors ... maybe?

At the moment the business plan has this list of opportunities:

* Pay for mentors to receive additional training
* Pay mentors explicitly for time mentoring
* Improve onboarding experience to increase numbers signing up for Premium membership (CRM)
* Additional outreach for contracts
* Additional outreach for grants

I'd love to improve the whole onboarding for new members, but if we do have a spike in Premiums we will need mentors ready to handle it.  I'm getting to my limit of being able to keep up, particularly if I'm taking the lead on delivering contracts like the one we have with the NHS.  Let's see what we can get done in the next six week chunk before my next 'rest' :-)
