So I'm heading in to central London again to work on this new UK National Health Service (NHS) wiki contract.  I'd already taken the train south of the river to meet with "Healthy London Partnership" (HLP) staff at NHS headquarters on Friday.  The AgileVentures charity (with support from AV Trustee Steve of Capable Communities and Mina of Enterprise Wellness) put in a proposal on an NHS "invitation to tender" a couple of weeks ago, and we've been awarded the contract.  The NHS headquarters is an imposing building just outside Elephant & Castle underground station, and the work comes from HLP itself which is is a collaborative enterprise of the 32 [Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_commissioning_group) in London and NHS England (London region), tasked with improving the health of Londoners.

The first thing I had to ask on Friday was what a "Clinical Commissioning Group" (or CCG) was, and apparently they are the management teams in charge of healthcare provision (and budget allocation) for a particular geographical region.  So, for example, if a new hospital was being built, or a new mental health care support framework was being rolled out, the local CCG would be choosing how to spend the money, and perhaps more importantly, what kind of services are being made available in a particular area. According to Wikipedia:

> CCGs are clinically led groups that include all of the GP groups in their geographical area. The aim of this is to give GPs and other clinicians the power to influence commissioning decisions for their patients

CCGs can be of different sizes, but usually (always?) have a director of commissioning who is the key decision maker.  The director receives recommendations from individual commissioners, of whom there might be 15-20.  In a given CCG one commissioner will have a brief that covers the self-care (SC) and social-prescribing (SP) that HLP believe can lead to better health and well-being for Londoners while avoiding rising costs.

HLP are trying to support the local CCG's to make effective choices for improving Londoners' health care.  In the context of the current project they've produced two documents to help NHS commissioners develop social-prescribing and self-care in their local areas.  The [first document](https://www.healthylondon.org/latest/publications/steps-towards-implementing-self-care) is already available online.  Social prescribing is about doctors providing patients with "prescriptions" for things other than drugs and medical treatment, such as activities with local volunteer groups; while self-care is all about empowering individuals to go out and take part in community activities.  There's some evidence to suggest that volunteering and connection to the community are good for individual's health and can lead to big cost savings for the health service.

HLP's concern is that while they are getting good feedback on the documents they have produced, they are likely to go out of date quickly.  They have a vision for living documents that will be updated by the commissioners themselves and other stakeholders in the voluntary sector.  For example, they imagine one commissioner having developed their own model and sharing that back so that all commissioners can learn from it.

The commissioners who might recommend (and/or implement) SC and SP in their local areas may be working alone, or with a small team, and will recommend service provisions and changes to the director of commissioning who will make the ultimate decision.  HLP works with a number of NHS public champions, who are people with long term experience as a patient or a carer.  One of the public champions suggested a wiki as a possible way of managing all the documents.  HLP are excited about the idea of "open sourcing" their materials to allow for collaborative development of living documents.   They have a small amount of money for developing and hosting a wiki system and also for moderating it for the next couple of years.

They are concerned about possible legal issues around who can post to the wiki, and so it seems we need a careful process to tease out their needs, and to work out what kind of system could achieve the outcomes they are looking for.  In discussion on Friday we came up with this very rough timeline of outcomes:

* 2 weeks: live with collaborative solution
* 3 months: can see people are using the system - see that people are contributing - see that it works
* 6 months: starting to see online community - people are responding to each other
* 12 months: understand the broader impact this is having - and we're seeing more SP and SC in London 
* 36 months: see positive health and finance impacts

I've proposed doing a design sprint to try and ensure we pick a solution that will give them the outcomes they are looking for.  There isn't sufficient money to build a custom solution, so we will need to go with an existing hosted wiki service, or an existing open source wiki that we can host for them.  It turns out that everyone on the HLP team is extraordinarily busy, so I'll be working with their outgoing change officer this week for the design sprint.  He's going to be the decider delegate and I'm going to be the facilitator, and while ideally we'd have many more people involved and more time in both our schedules, we're going to do the best we can.  The change officer has already reached out to various stakeholders to participate as experts or test users during the course of the week.  Design sprints are organised along these approximate lines:

* Monday: Frame and understand the problem
* Tuesday: Diverge and consider multiple solutions
* Wednesday: Converge on specific solutions
* Thursday: Prototype a solution
* Friday: Test with real users

and I'm taking components of Google and Thoughtbot's approaches to Design Sprints to create a week long process that handles the various constraints imposed by the context of the project.  Stay tuned to find out how it goes :-)
