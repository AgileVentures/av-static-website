I used Sunday afternoon to try and pay down some anxiety debt by dealing with certain tasks like trying to get out Google AdWords account re-instated (update: not yet). I got a few things done, but by no means all, and certainly not enough to prevent me having a rush of anxiety this morning.  It's the conflict between the urge to potter about responding to whatever's easiest, and the fear of the various time-sensitive steps that have to be taken.  I think top of the anxiety pile is the upcoming AgileVentures Annual General Meeting (AGM) and conference.  Here's some of my todo list:

* [ ] conference
  - [ ] get trustees the full details
  - [ ] confirm all speakers and ask them to prepare slides 
  - [ ] create calendar invites for AV conference
  - [ ] booking form for AV conference (meetup.com)
  - [ ] advertising AV conference
 
I start by sending slack messages to all the speakers to confirm their timeslots.  It's complicated by ongoing conversations I'm having with some of them ..., although I've now slacked all of them, and then just thought maybe I could have sent them all calendar invites instead of slacking them.  Hmm, do I send them invites as well now - I guess I put the events in the calendar and give everyone 48 hours to get back to me in Slack before sending invites.  I do worry about irritating people with comms in too many media.

So I go ahead and create events in google calendar for each talk/event.  I'll send invites to speakers after I've confirmed them in Slack.  I've also created a stub for the conference on meetup.com https://www.meetup.com/remote-pair-programming/events/251638253/ I'm wondering about setting attendance lists for each separate event so that people can book places ... but don't want to burn time creating separate ones right now.  Now I've got to really email all the trustees, and also work out the deal with the AGM.  Some relevant points from the [constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jlV2HjSUoitlGmj39IwCILIZoyAHBLRK05yvJ6EjoP0/edit):

> The AGM must receive the annual statement of accounts (duly audited or examined where applicable) and the trusteesâ€™ annual report, and must elect trustees as required under clause [13].

> The person nominated as chair by the charity trustees under clause [19](2) (Chairing of meetings), shall, if present at the general meeting and willing to act, preside as chair of the meeting. Subject to that, the members of the CIO who are present at a general meeting shall elect a chair to preside at the meeting.

We also need a quorum at the AGM, which is the greater of either 3 or 5% of the members.  Meeting must become quorate within 15 minutes of start of the meeting.  Voting is by a show of hands, with the chair tie-breaking.  And here's the thing I've been wanting to check, the question of how charity trustees get re-appointed:

> Any person who retires as a charity trustee by rotation or by giving notice to the CIO is eligible for reappointment. [A charity trustee who has served for [three] consecutive terms may not be reappointed for a [fourth] consecutive term but may be reappointed after an interval of at least [three years].] 

Okay, and I've emailed all the trustees ... getting there ...
