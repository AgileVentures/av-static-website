Urgh, so I developed a fever overnight.  Have taken painkillers and am now working from bed.  We made good progress yesterday in day two, reviewing many existing apps, and reviewing the clients protototype in some detail.  We've basically chucked the diverge/converge sketching activities and just gone for seeing if we can get some version of the clients overall design into a mobile app that they can test on Friday.  We had some success using expo and react native to generate an app that will run on a mobile device:

I was using reflector and airplay to mirror my iphone onto the desktop.  We were able to get images up into the app, and create an SVG setup where we could hide and show elements based on user interaction, which was a key portion of the client's intended prototype.  The client is planning to run tests with French sailors at a yacht club on Friday, so now we have two days to get the app shipshape.  This morning Federico and I have both got android emulators running, so we can develop in the same resolution/setup as the client's phone, which we hope they will be able to use for the testing on Friday.  Let's hope my fever doesn't get any worse ...
