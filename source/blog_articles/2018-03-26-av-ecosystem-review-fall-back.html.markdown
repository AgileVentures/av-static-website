So my attempt to blog in the evening did not get wonderfully far.  Exhaustion from the half marathon did not help.  Now the clock's have changed and it's time for the usual meeting chaos.  Of the many things going on I've decided to focus on trying to finish up the APSoc membership database.  The client has sent me the correct data which now needs to be imported into the system.  We've got a couple of bugs/usability issues still floating around, but I think I need to grapple with this data import to see what issues get thrown up ...

But then I can't help myself but take a screenshot of the warning I get that's related to the last issue the client brought up:

but I'm not sure there's an easy fix for it and the work around is for the client is to ensure they are always working with a saved user that has a membership id.  So I inspect the live data that needs importing which is a set of five XL tables.  I clean out the database of existing data and repair and compact it and get ready for an import process.  I think I need to ensure that we have the same columns in the Access and XL tables.  After adjusting the XL headings to precisely match those in the Access table I'm able to successfully import the membership types, but not so much luck with the members themselves, where I get a "subscript out of range" error ..., which is annoyingly uphelpful.

I added extra columns to the XL, but that didn't fix things and I was able to paste in a single row from the XL spreadsheet ..., hmm, and I was able to paste the entire lot in as a block - okay.  So I try the same thing on the GiftAid table, but no joy.  Can't import there or paste in ... ah, no.  Paste in works but I have to make sure to exclude the autonumbered id in the Access table.  And that allows me to complete the import and superficially it's all working.  I encrypt the database and send over to the client.  

The issue now is that I'm not sure I can really test all the data entry that the client will want without screwing with the production data, and realistically the client using it is the acid test of whether it will do everything they want.  So I guess I wait for feedback from the client ... not ideal, but the overall budget for this contract has long been exceeded by our attempt to use LibreOffice Base; and we really have no automated acceptance testing solution for MSAccess.  With more funds we could go to the client's location and manually record what they do and then use that to write a manual testing script that we execute by hand any time we make any changes, but the budget doesn't really justify that expense ... :-/
