So the thicket of urgent admin tasks is threatening to overwhelm me, as is the poor performance of my computer due to its age, my chrome tab addiction and by failure to reboot with any frequency.  Okay, priority number one, I must put in an invoice for the next chunk of private project work or I my finances will overheat ... right done that.  It involved going to a different browser and logging into my waveapps account.  I've managed to get the payment rate increased slighlty, but I think I'm still charging to little.  Well I guess I need to excel deliver great stuff and then talk about further adjustments.  Of course it's always much harder to price up after you've set a level, but anyway, what are all those other admin items that are strangling my mind?

1) finishing up my monthly report for the trustees
2) working out all the sponsorship ins and outs for AV
3) updating the APSoc client and approach going forward for the APSoc project
4) LBN project update
5) private music project update (emails sent)
6) GDPR crisis that my colleague is going through
7) Following up with GDPR lawyer

Can I get these in priority order:

1) updating the APSoc client and approach going forward for the APSoc project
2) GDPR crisis that my colleague is going through
3) finishing up my monthly report for the trustees
4) Following up with GDPR lawyer
5) working out all the sponsorship ins and outs for AV
6) LBN project update
7) private music project update (emails sent)

Other things on my mind:

1) create calendar invites for AV conference
2) booking form for AV conference
3) advertisting AV conference
4) google adwords reset
5) getting money ready for japan trip
6) replying to localsupport client

Urgh, so I've got a draft email ready to send to the APSoc client, and in the meantime I've noticed that my friend with the GDPR crisis has sent me all his login details so that I could potentially fix things up for him ... dive into that maybe?  Ah no the password needed is only saved on his computer.  So I've called him and he's going to call me back and we've spent an hour sorting it out, at least now he has cookiebot declarations of his cookies on his website ...
