Okay, so I'm totally confused.  Confused about which think to work on next, what to prioritize.  Is it partly that I'm not letting Google calendar run my schedule and I've stopped referring to my action plan document?  I feel like I've got a succession of todos surfacing in my head.  I'm afraid to dive in on any of them for fear that there's something else with higher priority.  I struggled to get started this morning, and after creating Kanji character tests for all my children I've tweeted/slacked the podcast I was listenining to on my morning jog.  I've ended up reviewing my slack and email and github notifications before pulling out this blog to try and settle my thoughts.

It was a bit of a frenetic week with trips to London on Tuesday and Wednesday ... I've got blogs from both days written offline on the train.  So what are all these things that need to get done:

* [ ] Blogging
  - [ ] post offline blogs (two AV, one sentience) 
    - [x] must sort that one with the onboarding
  - [ ] work out if I'm getting anywhere with all this blogging? switch to development stories?

* [ ] AgileVentures AGM conference
  - [ ] finalise schedule PRIORITY
    - [ ] include inviting trustee to speak? EMAILED
  - [ ] work out how the AGM trustee voting thing actually works
  
* [ ] Mentor incentive program
  - [ ] need to finish onboarding mentors PRIORITY SLACK JOAO AND FEDERICO
  
* [ ] London Brokerage Network project
  - [x] contact David

* [ ] West London Musicians project
  - [x] review specs
  
* [ ] Devops
  - [ ] continuous deployment for LocalSupport and Websiteone?

* [ ] LocalSupport
  - [ ] deploy
    - [ ] addressing build errors ...
  - [x] reply to Alex
  
* [ ] WebsiteOne
  - [ ] deploy
  
* [ ] NHS project
  - [ ] more GDPR actions?
  - [ ] invite folks to the mailing list
  - [ ] send more details to our agile coach
  
* [ ] Scheduling
  - [ ] reserve a day a week for the sentience project - Tuesdays?
  - [ ] adjust to one project a week after the break?
  
* [ ] edX online MOOC
  - [ ] do we run AV102 again?

* [ ] new computer?

* [x] RTI  
  
 Okay, that feels a bit better, but how to prioritize?
