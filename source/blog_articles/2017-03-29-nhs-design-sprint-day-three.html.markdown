So I realise that the sequencing on these sprint blogs is kind of off kilter, since I'm writing the blog on the morning of a given design sprint day, and actually talking about what happened the previous day.  Also, the schedule is being mashed into the available time, so let's relax and go with the flow :-) Yesterday was Tuesday and I was down at NHS headquarters again.  In the last blog we'd left it with me trying to work out whether to continue the day 1 sprint activities into day 2 in order to complete them, or just drop them and move onto the official day 2 activities.  Remaining from day one were:

* [ ] Ask the experts
* [ ] Generate "How Might We ...?" notes
* [ ] Organise notes
* [ ] Vote on notes
* [ ] Pick target

We had a meeting room from 10:30am-2:00pm, and I was just pondering what to do, when we were joined by Charlotte and Jason, two other members of the Healthy London Partnership team.  Serendipitously this seemed to match perfectly with continuing the day one agenda of asking the experts.  It would have been great to have Charlotte, Jason and others involved in the entire Sprint, but since that wasn't possible, getting their input on the Goal, Risks and Maps that Brendan and I had generated the previous day would be critical.  We had time for Jason and Charlotte to introduce themselves and explain their roles in the organisation, when the Decider Shaun joined us and we flowed into showing the full team what we had generated the previous day.

Brendan and I had struggled with a good summary sentence of the overall goal the previous day, but Shaun nailed it immediately with "Empowering patients and Enabling communities to take control".  We seemed to be on the same page as far as the high level goal was concerned.  We talked the group through the risks, which they concurred with, and they added some more including:

* Experience of system is poor or too cluttered
* Policy fatigue on the part of the Comissioners
* Lack of future enthusiasm from government on SP/SC initiatives
* Potential contributors put off my concerns about legal status of contributions

and another from Brendan having reflected overnight that politics with a small "p" might be a problem, e.g. if contributors used any system we developed as a platform for excessive criticism of existing solutions.

Next we took the group through the diagrams we had generated the previous day, which was particularly revealing.  As I explained the way that a commissioner who had been convinced to implement SP/SC might put out a tender to get bids from multiple SP service providers, Shaun indicated that maybe that shouldn't be a competitive process.  Rather it should be collaborative and in fact, G.P.s and Patients/Carers could be ambassadors for the programs.  Patients and Carers could be petitioning G.P.s for SP in their areas, leading to G.P.s to petition Commissioners. And indeed it could be teh Service Providers and Community Resource Providers who were collaborating to petition the commissioners, along with the G.P.s.  I added in arrows for these potential interactions:

Interestingly I got even more feedback on different models showing the diagram to Steve of Capable Communities that evening.  He's managed to draw down money from central government to implement a Social Prescribing system in my local area (Harrow) without having to go through the process of convincing the commissioners at the CCG.  He's now working with them, but brought the money in by collaborating with the local authority.  Fascinating how these box and arrow diagrams can draw things out.

The diagram focusing on how the commissioner interacts with the materials and information drew out more from Shaun on what makes up a commissioners day, and how it's filled with meetings, with perhaps slices of time to check email at the beginning and end of the day.  In addition, while commissioners might be the gatekeepers to unlocking funding.  Participation from the G.P.s was essential, and so ultimately any system would have to be meeting the needs of a much wider range of stakeholders to help SP/SC become a long term success.

The rest of the team had to go, so that left Brendan and I, and I pushed us through the remaining activities.  Again it would have been great for more of the team to be involved, but we did our best; generating "How Might We ..." questions on post it notes, arranging them in categories on the wall, and then voting on them and placing them on the maps:

It was slightly artificial and I was realising that ideally we'd have had the input of a lot more experts (G.P.s, Patient Champions, Commissioners etc.) before doing this HMW phase, but we were working within the constraints we had.  Either way it seemed clear we were targetting a system that had to be transparent in terms of usability of finding relevant information and editing it.  It also seemed to me that part of the problem we were solving was just creating a framework for the HLP organisation itself to manage it's information and resources in collaboration with a wider group of stakeholders.  If we could start with something that worked for HLP, we'd be half the way there, so I sat down with Brendan and starting looking at different online wiki solutions with him, recording the process using a quicktime screen recording.  More on those in tomorrow's blog!
