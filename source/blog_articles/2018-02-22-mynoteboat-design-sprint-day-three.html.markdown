Day three was punctuated by me developing a fever, which I controlled with painkillers and forged on.  We got a lot done.  PJ bought the boat image he wanted from shutterstock and we got that in the app and started having text appear and disappear next to dots that we overlaid over the boat:

a big chunk of the days work was getting forms working and having them store their data in local storage on the phone:

Towards the end of the day I started working on the main navigation:

Still a lot to do.  No way could we have prototyped something like this in a single day.  Other time was burnt getting android emulators setup.  It was great to have Nick contributing since he had a real android phone and was able to confirm that the words weren't very clickable and fixed that by adding rectangles to give them a bigger clickable area.  Now I've had another difficult feverish night and have taken more painkillers.  Can we get this app shipshape by the end of the day?  Let's see ...
