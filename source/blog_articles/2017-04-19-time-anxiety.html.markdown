I'm getting back into jogging, but still not getting up early enough to really reap much time from my wife taking the twins to school in the morning.  I maybe got an extra five minutes at the computer.  I burned at least three times that trying to use my phone to tweet the podcast from my morning run.  Hopefully by the end of the week I'll be back in rhythm and be social-media-ing effectively again.  It's lovely to get "likes" and "retweets" when I send out stuff about other folks' podcasts.  I've half a hope that in the long run it might help me distribute my blogs to a wider audience, but I won't get my hopes up.

I was planning to blog more about NHS meetings in the design sprint this morning, but it took forty minutes to review the six blogs from before the break to get my mind back to the point about what was the next thing I was supposed to be blogging about.  Specifically it's details from meeting with a social prescription service provider, and an academic studying the same.  However there's a question mark over what can be published about the NHS in these blogs, which should be resolved in a meeting tomorrow, so I'm tempted to hold fire till then.  In addition I've got quite a painful time anxiety at the moment about whether I'm allocating my time efficiently on different projects.  I have found another couple of grants I could apply for, and I need to do prep for the elixir mob.

Reviewing the NHS blogs has helped me recall all the detail of that previous week, but now I'm struggling to remember what I did yesterday.  I know we managed to have a Redeemify meeting where we worked out we should make a video demo-ing the current system for Armando.  We got Alex, Matt and Michael talking about fixes on WebSiteOne and dropping this priority project idea.  I met with drie to start testing more of their latest system, and I really can't recall what I did before lunch.  I know I spent a chunk of time looking at different Drupal installations (with an eye on the wikis we might use for the NHS project), and managed to speak to the NHS Communications person on the phone, and realised that we really need them in as an expert witness for the design sprint (meeting planned for Thursday).  I re-watched the Martin Fowler scrum from yesterday to try and remind myself and that didn't help - I feel like I lost a chunk of time yesterday morning.  I think it probably went to reviewing all the email and Slack messages that were still backed up from my week off, reaching out to mentors to see if they are interested in being sponsored for agile/scrum certifications (answer is yes and no), and tweaking the AV business plan.

Gosh what a flurry of different bits and pieces.  I think it's deep breathing to manage the time anxiety and once more unto the breach, dear friends! :-)
