Pair programming - as any relatively new programming methodology, such as BDD, TDD - is a controversial matter. The controversy is good. It helps define the relevant applications of the methodology. In their books "better, faster and lighter java", Bruce Tate and Justin Gehtland explain that, when you have a new drill, any problem relates to drilling a hole. You may end up trying to open a bottle of beer with a drill. And obviously, with any new technology or methodology, you go through skepticism, enthusiasm and disappointment.  Eventually, after drilling holes anywhere in your house, you grasp the reasonable use cases. 
 
Controversies about pair programming arise at Agile Ventures, too. Well, even if many members are very experienced pair programming practitioners, many others - including me - are still looking for their pair programming comfort or efficiency zone. We sometimes discuss this topic with Sam - we might bore him with our wavering and he might think "why the hell do they spend time talking rather than coding? :-)". We finally agree on at least four cases where pair programming is a good fit :

  1) When we start to code a functionality : because getting up in the morning is always a challenge  
  2) When we're stuck : because it's good to have someone that tells you to look at the top when we keep on looking for an exit at the bottom without finding it   
  3) When we want to complete a task :  because a pair programming buddy will help you to overcome your obsession of perfectionism or your fear to put things to an end, so that deadlines are met  
  4) When we need to improve our skills : Programming is often like a shared secret. Everybody has got a piece of the whole puzzle.  
  
Starting a task, being stuck, achieving things, improving our skills are not specific to progamming. I gradually notice that there are many other professional circumstances where pairing is a valuable way to get things done :

  - System administration : Configuring or troubleshooting a system
  - Document, presentation : Writing a presentation or a document
  - Project management : ordering ideas, prioritizing tasks
  - Problem solving : Trying to describe / figure out the nature of a question by gathering figures and facts in a spreadsheet
   
Before I began to practice remote pair programming with Agile Ventures, I felt that working remotely was quite a challenge. For instance, proof-reading 
a document with your team on a conference call is not easy. You have to tell everybody which page you're working on, and once you modified the document,
the page numbering is not consistent anymore. You spend more time synchronizing people than working on the document.
 
Synchronizing the context between participants in a distant meeting is a key aspect. If interactions are limited to only a channel, whatever it is, audio, chat, email, slack, synchronization is not possible. As soon as you add a second channel, for instance screen sharing + audio, the sync problem disappears. There are many tools available to sync people. It took me time to find the right combinations, depending on the task at stake and the work habits.  Sometimes, we work with teamviewer on the phone. Sometimes, we use online tools like zoom.us, or webex. Sometimes, we use videoconference tools  like Skype or hangouts. Sometimes, we work with mobile tools, like WhatsApp. The tool is not a great barrier as long as every participant can install it
on his terminal, the quality of streaming is correct and it offers tools to interact with others to every participant, chatting, writing on the displayed document, talking.

Distance, that was detrimental when working on a conference call, becomes an advantage :

  - The shared screen becomes everybody's screen. Anyone can participate, correct, add his own contribution to the work.
  - Some basic physical constraints such as finding a layout of the room so that every participant can watch the screen and participate disappears.
  - Various barriers like psychology, hierarchy, physical proximity or language barriers are lowered. People can choose to ask questions by chat or on the voice channel for instance, depending on their favorite way of communicating.
  - Participants can be more focused on the real goal at stake
  - And last but not least, it costs much less than a physical meeting

Pair-programming may be a controversial topic but my experience of using the methodology to work on other subjects such as sys admin or document writing has been very profitable. I hope my post inspires you to begin pair-working or even mob-working!
