So I squeezed in a LocalSupport client meeting this morning and I have a F2F pairing session coming up, so there's not much time for review.  I'm thinking I should focus next week on Jitsi on Azure, although I'd love to revisit our slack bots, pings, and even consider a react-ification of our getting started pages.

However I think the most important thing for me to do right now is work through the follow up from the LocalSupport client meeting.  LocalSupport is our longest running project and is a key part of the AgileVentures ecosystem.  I had what felt like  a productive meeting in that I had managed to implement some cost savings for LocalSupport by switching to free https certificates.  I still wonder if I should have been further questioning whether VAHC really wanted to push forward with this project, but hey, who knows.

The key thing now is that the client asked to have put on a "back burner" certain tickets that had been started by some developers.  These relate to members of the public being able to submit new events.  We also rejected a ticket on the breadcrumbs functionality in the system.  Now I have the choice to be alerting developers through the Pivotal Tracker system or through Slack.  I'll start with the tracker, and then maybe follow up in Slack.  It's potentially a sensitive thing as it will probably mean shifting people around on what they're working on and some careful explanations of what's going on.

Just jumping to GitHub to review the pull requests I see GitHub now has new vulnerability checks:

This is flagging a low risk vulnerability in RuboCop - we can easily upgrade that, but I don't want to get distracted.
