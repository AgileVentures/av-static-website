My main achievement on Friday was opening a bank account for the AgileVentures charity.  This has been a long time coming.  I originally started with Lloyds bank and spent an hour or so on the phone explaining the whole concept of "in context learning on charity IT projects" to them, before receiving a lot of self-contradictory paperwork that they didn't respond to my email queries about.  The need for a bank account has become more pressing as we start to have a non-trivial Premium payments coming through Stripe.  It's still a small trickle, but with our new sponsor drie, we're on the road to becoming sustainable early next year if we can sustain our current rate of growth.  That might make it sound like we can just wait for that growth to happen, but every little bit of growth requires a lot of hard graft on my part, as well as lots of generous donations of time and effort from our AV mentors.  I also have to make sure that in the process of bringing in new sponsors and premium members that we keep supporting our existing sponsors and premium members.  Simplify, Eliminate, Delegate, Automate!

Having given up on making progress with Lloyds, I heard that the new UK bank "Metro" had a reasonable charity account, and that some other local charities had got set up with them before official UK charity status approval (which we are still waiting for - no updates since July ...), and seeing their neat, open-plan branch in my local town centre, and their modern looking website I thought I'd give them a try.  I've also received advice that the Coop bank and Triodos are good options.  Metro had an email link for charities and I emailed them and got an email bank within a day.  They were responsive by email which was a big plus.  I did notice that I was emailing a specific person at Metro bank rather than a `charities@metrobank.co.uk`, but I pressed on.  We needed to provide the charity constitution, signed minutes of a trustees meeting agreeing to open the bank account, various ID for the bank account signatories, and fill out an application form.

Over the course of several weeks we assembled all the different components and sent them off to my contact at the head office.  We had a good back and forth in email with my contact checking electronic copies of the documents before I mailed in signed versions.  It seemed to be going well.  I got the last package of documents together and sent of, paying extra for a verified delivery.  Then nothing.  No communication.  My emails unanswered.  My contact also had a cellphone number on their email signature.  I texted, I left messages, nothing.  After a few days I started calling the head office and trying to get them to contact me.  It turned out that my contact was on annual leave.  Fair enough, although it would have been nice to be getting annual leave notification messages against the emails I was sending.  I was starting to get frustrated.

It turns out that another person was trying to contact me via email, but they had my email address mis-spelt from the operators I'd been speaking to when I was calling the bank.  Eventually we got that figured out, but I didn't manage to make a connection with this person.  They kept on asking me to send in additional paperwork that I believed I had already sent.  I held off as presumably my original contact would soon be back from annual leave and could sort it out.  It stretched out and it seemed that annual leave had become leaving.  I finally managed to speak to the new contact in real time on the phone and established that we had sent in all the paperwork, but that we would have to go into the bank to confirm our identities.

My plan to save time by doing this all online had backfired.  I'd been trying to prefer email but that had caused delays.  Finally on Friday Rachel and I went into the bank and got our identities confirmed, and started working through the other paperwork.  Ultimately it took over 2 hours, first because the bank was saying the accounts they provided couldn't support the detailed finance policy we'd put in the minutes.  I was fuming.  I called up the other trustees and on speaker phone allowed the bank manager to hear their approval for an account without detailed support for the finance policy which we would be implementing ourselves rather than relying on bank restrictions.

That done the bank manager had to re-type the entire PDF application form that I had filled out and sent in.  I was hoping that a recently setup modern bank would be just the sort to avoid this sort of ridiculousness.  Rachel and I caught up and I supported the AV slack channels in the background as we ground through the process.  We were just about to give up and leave when it was all done.  We got bank cards, and I got the online banking hooked up, and the all important sort code and account number that would allow me to issue new invoices and sort out the AgileVentures finances.

I still like what MetroBank is trying to do.  I think the UK banking industry is ripe for disruption.  Maybe it being difficult to open an account is in some sense a feature.  Convoluted and unnecessary steps discourage all those but the truly serious.  Maybe one day the decentralised cryptocurrencies will replace all this, but I'm not holding my breath ...
