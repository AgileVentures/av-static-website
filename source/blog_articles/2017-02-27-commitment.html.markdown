Urgh, another mild cold :-( but a productive few days.  We had our new style WebSiteOne kick-off meeting on Friday following Michael's suggestion that we re-start the meetings, but that we each bring up to three tickets that we care about; rather than just working through whichever tickets are in the backlog.  This approach came out of discussions around the AgileBookClub podcast, with an emphasis on focusing on the "business" value associated with each ticket.  I chose the following tickets:

* [Add tooltips for "upgrade to mob" to explain and/or add info buttons](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1530)
* [Adjust initial messaging](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1555)
* [Adjusting how "next scrum" is displayed to new users](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1554)

while Michael chose the following:

* [Change call to action button verbiage](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1560)
* [Alternatives to google hangouts for pairing and scrums](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1487)
* [Convert Sign up links into big, orange buttons](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1523)

and we worked through each, writing new user-stories informed by our recent AgileBookClub podcast discussions.  Here are Michael's tickets and the user stories we added.

### Convert sign up links into big, orange buttons

```
As an AgileVentures Admin
So that more people ultimately sign up for paid plans
I would like prominent buttons for sign up on the plan description pages
Whereas currently they are simply hyperlinks
```

### Alternatives to google hangouts for pairing and scrums

```
As AgileVentures Admin
So that we can analyze usage patterns and reflect teleconference participation in member profiles
I would like some mechanism for tracking teleconference participation 
Instead of the Google Hangouts API which is being removed in April

As AgileVentures Scrum master
So that I don't have to manually copy and paste teleconference details into other media
I would like some mechanism to alert potential participants that a teleconference is taking place (hangout and video stream)
Instead of the Google Hangouts API which is being removed in April
```

### Change call to action button verbiage 

```
As an AgileVentures Admin
So that as many people as possible click through and sign up for membership and subscriptions
I want consistent and simple messaging on buttons (e.g. get started) that lead them to sign up/subscription pages
Instead of the current variation in messaging
```

We also voted on the tickets using Arreche's new AsyncVoter system which worked really well, and we were very pleased to have Raoul join us.  We got through the 6 tickets in good time, and most of them, with the exception of the hangout API one, were one point stories.  Following what I had been hearing from Pat and his running of the WikiEduDashboard scrum/sprint I committed to completing my three tickets before another meeting the following Friday.  Michael committed to doing one of his, and I asked if he could investigate [another ticket](https://github.com/AgileVentures/av-static-website/issues/206) related to the static site.

I'd been reading about the importance of these kind of commitments in Agile as part of research for a chapter on a book I'm writing on Agile methods in Open Source development.  According to Wikipedia, the Scrum methodology includes [five values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Values) which include "Commitment", specifically that:

> Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every Sprint.

Over the last year I've been gradually sliding away from any formal sprint cycle on the projects I'm managing, as I get dispirited and demotivated by the difficulties I've faced trying to arrange regular meetings at times that everyone can attend.  I was also getting the sense that folks were not enthusiastic about such meetings, and so it's kind of a breakthrough with Michael to discover that the problem was not necessarily the presence of a meeting, per se, but the structure of that meeting.  Michael's enthusiasm for the new structure is helping me feel more motivated for sprint cycle meetings.  I asked Michael at the end of the meeting on Friday if things had gone as he had hoped, if the discussion had been at the right level and he said yes, and so hopefully we can continue this format next week.

It's funny - I'm just really happy to keep bashing away at tickets - happy with little structure, but I do notice that without a commitment to getting particular things done, all my different admin tasks can trump development work.  Maybe I do need a little more structure and commitment ... although trying to get people to make committments to doing things makes me feel strange.  In some ways I would rather they wouldn't commit and then either just do, or not do.  In the absence of any committment there is no disappointment :-) Then again maybe making small structured committments is a framework and more folks will feel positive in the long run?  We'll see :-)
