I wavered a little in my blog consistency over the Easter break.  I was working last week, but the kids were off school.  Even with them back at school I'm not sure if I can sustain daily blogging activity.  I'm thinking of blogging and publishing on alternate days, we'll see.

However while there is much programming to be done, I also need to communicate the latest developments in the NHS HLP wiki project to the rest of the team, and also reflect my understanding back to our client.  The big event of last week was Thursday when I travelled down to one of the large NHS offices to sit in on the "Proactive Care" Programme Delivery Group meeting.  As I understand it, it's the Proactive Care team that commissioned the wiki and who we have been working with for the last year.  It might seem odd that I'm slightly unsure on that, but is a reflection of the nested layers of the NHS organisation, one of the largest employers in the world.   It's always been clear to me that we are working with the [Healthy London Partnership (HLP)](https://www.healthylondon.org/) an organisation put together by the various London Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) that are responsible for health spending in each of the London boroughs.  HLP consists of many different teams, which might include the following:

 * Cancer
 * Children and young people
 * Crisis care
 * Digital
 * Homeless health
 * Improvement collaborative
 * London choosing wisely
 * Mental health
 * Prevention
 * Primary care
 * Proactive care
 * Urgent and emergency care
 * Workforce
 
Or some subet of those.  I've taken the above from the list of "Our work" from the HLP website.  It includes "Proactive care" and I've run training sessions where other HLP members have mentioned they are on the prevention or mental health team.  So the Proactive care vision statement from the website is:

> Our vision is for all Londoners to be more proactively involved in their health and wellbeing and the health and care system. Effective engagement will happen at an individual and collective level and will be universally accepted as key to good care and support.

And of course it follows that Social Prescribing and Self-care fall under this remit.  So I guess that the "Proactive Care" Programme Delivery Group meeting is all about checking in on progress towards this vision.  The Proactive Care team has around eight members most of whom I've worked with in different capacities as part of the wiki's development, maintenance and moderation.  I don't think I've attended any "Delivery Group" meetings before.  I hear these take place every six weeks or so.  It was not quite as big a meeting as I had attended for one of the regional CCG gatherings, but there seemed to be quite a variety of folks involved.  There were a few attending via phone conference, but there were stakeholders from multiple London CCG regions, GPs, NHS England, Patient Champions, academics and the fire service.

The entire HLP Proactive Care team were present and there were a fair few items on the agenda.  One big one was the "Self-Care Social Prescribing Evaluation Report" from the Kensington and Chelsea Social Council (KCSC) and NHS West London CCG.  I'd been out to KCSC as part of the design sprint when we were initially designing the wiki.  The [full report is available online](https://www.kcsc.org.uk/sites/kcsc.org.uk/civi_files/files/civicrm/persist/contribute/files/Self%20Care/7641_SROI-Report_DIGITAL_AW.pdf) and the headline is £2.80 of social value created per £1 invested in the project.  Apparently:

>  The Self-Care social prescribing model has led to reduced avoidable need for hospitalisations, reduced need for GP practice hours, and reduced levels of physical pain and depression for patients.

There were a fair few more agenda items before we got to the social prescribing wiki.  The new home page designs that we'd sketched had been printed out, and we had a short discussion about their relative merits and the future development of the wiki.

We got some immediate snippets of feedback on the designs, for example that rather than mentioning G.P.s we should refer to "Health Professionals", and that perhaps the main front page design should be more about the information you want rather than focusing on the person you are.  That latter was feedback from one G.P. and was in contrast to the feedback we'd had from another G.P. who had wanted things broken up in terms of who you were, rather than the type of information as it is currently laid out on the wiki, although the current layout is rather a sprawl:

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/jlwv3fp0a9fbb2f/Screenshot%202018-04-16%2010.19.33.png?dl=0)

The G.P. continued to indicate that they'd like to see evidence and evaluation.  Others spoke about more interactivity and a need to explore the language around social prescribing.  Perhaps community blogs, or blogs from patients and professionals.  A patient champion suggested there was an opportunity to develop a house style and maybe re-use materials from an animation on social precscribing that HLP was developing.

After the main meeting broke up we had some further time with the core HLP team and the patient champion.  The patient champion was keen to get a directory of services that might help with specific conditions.  They suggested adding "directories" item to the "resources for patients" section.  I asked for the top level vision for the wiki, and was told that while ideally it would ultimatley be used by everyone, that initially it should still focus on commissioners, G.P.s and health care professionals.

There was also suggestions of including resources for Social Prescribing Link workers, those who evaluate patient referrals from G.P.s and help patients connect with local resources in their community.  Apparently there's a particular need to connect link workers across regional boundaries, since they may not always have the latest information about what's available in neighboring boroughs.  Other requests/suggestions included:

* Directories of services linked into the wiki
* Embedding the twitter feed in the hompage
* Creating SP email alerts
* News feed on SP in the home page
* More on evaluation and case studies (for commissioners)
* Doing a wiki hour on Fridays at 4:30pm
* Speaking to commissioners to ask them:
  - what inspired them to fund SP
  - what will cause them to renew
  - what is the process they go through
* Specific business cases for commissioners, e.g. diabetes, loneliness, social-isolation
* Multiple pathways through the site
  - how do I build a business case?
  - how do I ...?
* Focusing on making the wiki as easy as possible to edit by HLP staff
* Making the wiki as easy to consume as possible by commissioners
* Making the search functionality more noticeable

We seemed to home in on a smaller set of stakeholders by the end, which made sense in terms of reducing the scope of the problem to ensure that we met the needs of some clear stakeholders rather than trying to meet everyone's needs and thus failing to be especially effective for anyone in particular.

So the main action item became get together a list of commissioners to see if we could identify some to work with as part of a design sprint.  I also began to formulate a plan to spend more quality time with HLP staff in order to better understand the challenges they were facing in editing content in the wiki.  There are so many different angles on this big picture; we'll keep chipping away with all our tools to try and deliver the most value we can.
