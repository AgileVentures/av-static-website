Second day in a row that I'm heading into London.  This time for a breakfast at Pivotal Labs. I've set up a meeting with them with a few objectives in mind:

1) check out their event space
2) see if digital charities can use their event space
3) see if AgileVentures could use their event space
4) find out more about there P.Act initiative
5) see if they are interested in being referred some leads that we can't pick up on	

Then I've got a meeting about a private coding project even further across town.  I want to read the docs for that, but Slack doesn't seem to allow you to browse between windows when offline anymore.  That's quite frustrating.  I've got to ping them about that

> I notice recently that when I am offline that I can no longer navigate between different slack channels.  Extremely inconvenient when I am out of signal range and need to refer to the contents of a particular channel or DM - is that intentional?  Something that could be fixed?

Anyway, managed to have a good meeting with the Pivotal folks, generating a bunch of action items, specifically

* connect them with Charles of SavingOurPlanet.net
* connect with digital charities
* maybe a one page pdf on AV for to go to other clients

I can't immediately motivate myself to write up a one page pitch, but I did a slew of email connections, and then headed out further east for a meeting about the private electron app I've been working on.  I got to meet the client and pitch some user interface ideas.  I feel kind of crushed between working on this to generate immediate revenue, and working on everything for the charity.

I guess I've got to get a handle on all the documentation for our operating procedures for AgileVentures so that the folks I'm delegating to know what to do - of course it would be lovely to automate everything, but I think the first step has to be human readable documentation.  So what have we got:
