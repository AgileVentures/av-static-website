  description: >
    The NHS needed a wiki to organise all the various docs and ideas on the concepts of Social
    Prescribing and Self Care that would work on NHS and Local Authority computers.  Network security
    issues prevented a variety of wiki's from working.  The exception was the battle-tested Wikipedia
    MediaWiki system which AgileVentures customised, deployed and hosts for the NHS Healthy London Partnership
    giving ongoing community moderation and marketing support.
